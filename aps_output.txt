Do you know 10 Out of 5 SaaS Websites do this mistake & that’s why their lead Generation Process is poor?


The Mistake is "Fear of adding External Link "


Let’s discuss deep diving.


Last month, 3 SaaS marketers reached out to me on LinkedIn regarding "struggling to grow qualified leads "


I audited their website and was shocked to find that, despite generating over 50,000 organic traffic they weren't ranking for any Purchase Intent KW.


Wanna know what’s the problem?

The problem is the fear of adding an external link.

After reviewing their websites, I discovered that they did not write about a single piece of content, such as "list," "alternatives," "competitor pricing," "you vs. competitors," and "many more BOFU content."

I asked them why you guys don’t work on them, and they told me we can’t add an external link and we can’t mention our competitors' products, plus I can’t give a link to them and that's why are not creating any BOFU content

And that’s the reason these guys are not bringing results, and that's the mistake most SaaS companies make.

I strongly believe if you are a SaaS company and you make this type of mistake and fear adding external links to your competitor just because thinking about so-called tips in SEO is "Link Equity," then ultimately you lose "Money on the Table," and if you don’t focus on them, then your competitor takes this advantage and grows their business.

My feedback for every SaaS marketer is to always learn from the search results and your competitors' lead generation strategies, and apart from this, also learn from some big players like HubSpot, Jotform, and Databox many more what they guys do to increase organic traffic and leads.






1/ Refine your target audience:
Focus on attracting the right users who are most likely to convert and see value in your product. Use customer feedback and data to adjust your targeting and messaging accordingly.


2/ Offer personalized onboarding:
Create a personalized onboarding experience that guides users through your product and highlights the benefits they'll receive. Use automation to streamline the process and increase efficiency.


3/ Increase trial activation:
Boost your trial activation rates by offering incentives and resources during the trial period. Use data to identify areas of improvement and make changes accordingly.


4/ Nurture your leads:
Create a system for following up with leads and nurturing them until they're ready to convert. Use targeted messaging and content to build trust and establish credibility.


5/ Use data to optimize:
Collect and analyze user data to identify patterns and trends. Use this information to optimize your product, marketing, and sales strategies for maximum impact.




Is your content a resource? Or is it just a pile of words published as an article to rank on Google?




There's a difference between content that's written for customers to solve their problems, as opposed to content that is written to rank in the SERP solely.




The latter has zero intent + zero value.




Mindless keyword stuffing does not work anymore. Driving targeted traffic and converting them into customers has become harder than ever.




If you as a B2B or SaaS company, want to rank higher in order to get discovered by your ICP, solve their problems and increase your revenue - you need to build more credibility and demonstrate your expertise in a particular micro-niche.


So basically, if you want to beat the noise and get your voice heard, first prove that it's worth listening to!




But how will you do that?




The answer is by building stronger authority around one Topic!




Topical Authority is the future of Content Marketing or SEO. This is how SaaS brands will be able to demonstrate their expertise on a relevant topic by creating more "helpful content" around it!




By consistently doing that your audience will start perceiving you as an expert and so will Google.




As said by Erica Schneider, "Topical authority, therefore, is a strategic play to cater to both algorithmic and psychological preferences."




Here's how you can build stronger topical authority and increase your revenue faster without trying to compete with the biggies in your industry ⤵️




~ narrow down on a topic cluster that'll attract highly targeted and relevant traffic to your content channel




~ create information-rich content and make sure it adds value to the ongoing conversation instead of repeating the same thing that has already been said on the web




~ Identify the existing gaps in the market on that topic and fill those with your Content




~ Create an Internal Linking Strategy and link back to your own pages which are highly relevant or is a part of your topic cluster to signal google that THIS is your area of expertise




TA is the new way to think about SEO which will not just help you rank, but also increase your revenue exponentially!




In every discovery call I have, this is one question that comes up almost as soon as we describe what goes into content marketing.


My answer 👉 Depends on how strategic and consistent you are👈


After having worked with multiple B2B SaaS companies, here are my notes (and responses) to the question above:


👉 The business goals you set have an impact on the KPIs you measure


👉 The finality in your vision, mission and product messaging (because each time you're going to look at the results differently)


👉 The KPIs you measure have an impact on how much value you 'see' in content marketing (which is often unrealistic metrics)


👉 The approach to content marketing (is it based on concrete market research, SEO, sales alignment or are we just 'writing' content based on executive inputs')


👉 The consistency with which you followthrough the content marketing plan (how often you pause, stop, change, pivot your direction; because each time, you will set a different performance indicator)


👉 The content optimization and distribution strategies you set up alongside (emails, ads, social media, etc)




The past 6 months have been a rollercoaster of learning and growth for me in the world of SaaS link building🔗


It's been a challenging but rewarding✨ journey, and I'm beyond thrilled to share my experience with the world.


Throughout the process, I discovered that generating high-quality backlinks is all about having a solid strategy and executing it effectively.


From outreach to content creation, every aspect of the process must be top-notch to attract and retain high-authority links.


I'm proud to say that our efforts have paid off, and we have generated over 4,000 high-quality🔥 backlinks for Technology Counter.


These backlinks have not only improved SERP rankings but have also driven significant amounts of referral traffic to the websites.


Here are a few strategies that have helped me in my SaaS link-building journey:


• Content Marketing - Creating high-quality, informative, and valuable content is key to attracting links. Focus on creating content that provides value to your target audience and shares it through various channels to reach a wider audience.


• Outreach - Building relationships with other websites and influencers in your niche is crucial. Personalized outreach emails that offer value and build rapport can help you secure links from reputable sites.


• Guest Posting - This involves writing blog posts for other websites in your niche in exchange for a link back to your site. Look for websites with high authority and a relevant audience to maximize the impact of your guest post.


• Broken Link Building - Find broken links on websites in your niche and reach out to the site owner to offer a replacement link from your website. This can help build relationships with other websites and improve your own search engine rankings.


• Infographics and Visual Content - Infographics and other types of visual content can be an effective way to attract links.






98% of b2b saas content marketing fails because of these mistakes:


- Positioning their products as fir-for-all instead of niching down
- Copying competition strategies
- Pushing out content without a strategy
- Not using your actual product screenshots
- Present on many channels, but consistent nowhere
- Not talking to your customers
- Having an intern manage your social channels




95% of b2b saas marketing today fails to hit the mark because of these mistakes:


- Positioning products as fit-for-all instead of niching down
- Copying competition strategies
- Pushing out content without a strategy
- Not using your actual product screenshots anywhere
- Present on many channels, but consistent nowhere
- Not talking to your customers
- Having an intern manage your social channels




Most SaaS founders and marketers are not creating content for each customer persona who is willing to use their product. and that’s why smart marketers and founders easily grab this opportunity to acquire new customers.


🎯A content strategy is knowing your audience really well!


Yeah, it's time for you to put on your detective hat and find every relevant detail about your audience.


For ex - their demographics, their pain points, their go-to communication channel, their goals and what takes them to make a decision.


- 🎯 It's all about collaborating


Get your product, sales, and customer success teams to understand what kind of questions your audience has.


And most importantly - how are they interacting with your product? And what are they struggling most with the product?


- 🎯 What's a Content Strategy without distribution?


Content strategy is about figuring out the ideal content distribution channels for your product.


And it has to be where your audience is actively hanging out.


- 🎯 It's about figuring out the right content processes to manage the entire team.


And knowing the metrics to track to ensure you can see how your current strategy is performing.


Stop treating a content calendar like a content strategy. You gotta dig deeper with all the questions.


As a SaaS writer, I have to keep the content marketing funnel in my mind before I jump start.


So, the truth is-


✅ There is no universally applicable method of content strategy.


Ultimately, it comes down to your goals.


❓Are you trying to broaden your brand's exposure or boost your conversion rate?


🌟 TOFU works best for problem-solvers. Connect with the right people and expand your brand's influence.


🌟 MOFU is appropriate for an aware audience seeking answers that meet their demands.


🌟 BOFU is most effective when shown to consumers who are seriously considering making a purchase.


👆 Highlight your product's advantages over the competition.


Blending these 3 into a cohesive strategy will keep leads moving through your content funnel.




The best way to find new blog topics for your SaaS business to generate more qualified traffic is to ask questions from your users! When they visit your website,

In this post, I am sharing the exact inbound marketing strategy to help me find a new topic for my previous SaaS project that generates qualified traffic around a customer's core need.

Tip 1: Ask the Question to Users in Your Lead Form

Question Example: "What are you planning to use Hotjar for?"

We know every SaaS product solves XYZ's problem, so why can't we note them and understand why people are looking to fill out my lead form, what their problem is, what the industry is, and how they plan to use my product?

This is the perfect strategy to improve your product and also find new topics around your customer's core needs.

Tip 2: Run the exit popup to find new topics

I observe that many brands run exit popups to improve conversion and also find new topic ideas.

Example: Run an exit popup and ask questions to your users.

Question Example: What topics related to [conversion rate optimization] would you like to learn more about?

Bonus: You can also improve your existing blog while asking this question.

Question: Do you find our current blog posts on [Lead Generation ] helpful in addressing your pain points? If not, what improvements would you suggest?

Tip 3: Conduct a survey and feedback campaign.

Customer surveys are one of the best ways to collect customer feedback to improve your product, and you can also use surveys to find new blog topics.

Here’s an example: Ask this question to your users on your website.

Question: Which topics have you found most interesting or helpful on our blog so far? Are there any related topics that you would like to see us cover in the future?"

This strategy helps you find new topics and create content that truly solves the problems of your audience.




That's because successful B2B content marketing is more than just writing a generic blog. 🤷


✔️It's about creating a valuable resource for your target audience and showing them how they can solve their problems with your products or services.


So, what is product-led content?


In a nutshell, product is the star of a product-led content piece.


It tells a story about how it can help people accomplish something or solve their problems.🙌🙌




👉👉Why is it even necessary?


📍Shows how your product solves a problem for your target audience


📍Helps with customer acquisition


📍Improves the inbound marketing strategy of your company


📍Can Lead to a free trial


📍Supports Customer Retention, as blogs can educate the product's use cases.




You are selling to a knowledgeable audience who are looking to buy your product category. They are not looking to learn the fundamentals of the industry. Instead, they want a reason to sign up for your demo or buy your product right away. But, there are other players in the market. It means you have a very small window to showcase your product's features and benefits to convince them you are worth spending money on.
So, let's go straight into it. You will need to develop your SEO content strategy with lead generation as your objective. At this point, your main focus should be to find keywords in your industry with buying intent. These are the keywords that are likely to convert rather than the keywords that aim at brand awareness and growing traffic.
For instance, for an email marketing saas tool, forget keywords that define what email marketing software is or how it works. Remember you are speaking to a very specific and knowledgeable audience. Instead, narrow it down to either:
1. Category keyword e.g. Email Marketing Software for small businesses
2. Product use case keywords (this target what pain points your product solves e.g. it could be an email marketing software with powerful analytics and reporting features. Basically, identify the one feature your SaaS provides better than your competitors)
3. Comparison (vs) and Alternative keywords e.g ActiveCampaign Vs Sendinblue: What's the best email marketing software for B2B (Understand that your prospect is probably using another tool already and they are looking to switch to a better one. This is your chance to showcase your SaaS unique features against your competitor. If they are not looking to switch, they are comparing your tool with your competitor's tools)
The key takeaway is to stop chasing traffic and start chasing qualified leads. Target the BOFU (bottom of the funnel) keywords and pitch your product in your content.




So, there’s been a lot of hype around podcasts and TikTok and Instagram and blah, blah..
But, here’s the thing.
Unless you’re advertising on those platforms, they will:
1. Take longer to materialize than blog posts
2. Yield a smaller ROI than blog posts.
For the sake of this post, I will concede certain products can do better on social media. Maybe even productized services (OnlyFans lol). And social media and podcasts do have their place in branding.
However, for most service-based businesses? Especially B2B? Yeah.. your ICP is not searching for “the tax liability for cross-border e-commerce sales“ on TikTok.
That said, I’m going to use an example of a financial consulting firm to illustrate how content marketing can basically make you a millionaire over time.
Consider the landscape [example]
Let’s say, you’re the owner of a financial consulting and accounting firm, and before starting your own firm you did some client work as a freelancer or as part of another company.
Additionally, you’re certified as a CPA, or whatever degree you need to practice your specific financial service.
Now, you know you’re accredited, and you know you’re good at your work, but you need clients to get paid.
At this point, most people in your position as a new business owner will start networking, advertising, cold emailing etc. to gain some initial momentum.
Nothing wrong with that.
On the contrary, you need to hustle to get some clients initially. However, you can’t keep hustling for the next client forever. At some point soon, you’re going to want to create a predictable source of leads.
If your plan is to keep hustling for the next client all day and have no freedom of time or money, what was the point in starting a business?
Now, I’m going to demonstrate how content marketing will serve as a predictable, sustainable high-quality engine of clients.
How blog posts turn your website into a client-attracting machine
In a nutshell, blog posts get you paid by motivating readers of your posts to sign with you as a client.
Blog posts achieve this result by
1. Ranking on Google for queries relevant to your ICP/audience persona, so they can find your post.
2. Converting your ICP to a paying customer by giving them an effective solution to the query they typed into Google.
Here’s why ranking on Google works so well to convert your ICP.
1. It proves you are an authority on the subject
If Google has decided to show your website as one of the first results for your audience’s query, you must have SOME sort of credibility. That’s what goes through your reader’s minds when they see you as the first result.
2. It shows you have expertise dealing with your reader’s problem
Once your reader opens your post to read it, and you’ve provided an awesome and well-crafted solution to their problem, they will recognize your expertise in your domain.
Probably even better than if you took a meeting with them because they can pore over every word in your content.
This helps them understand what you’re saying at their own pace.
During meetings a lot of times your leads will just nod along to not sound stupid, but not actually understand a thing. Then they will be too hesitant to bring up the point(s) they didn’t understand and just continue believing you’re not the right solution provider for them.
Written content does away with any ambiguity.
3. It inspires trust in you and your agency
Your readers are not stupid.
When they had a query and they see you giving an otherwise paid solution away for free, it makes them believe you’re looking out for their best interests.
Here’s why:
• They know you can provide this solution.
• They know it took you time to write and edit this solution.
• They know that under normal circumstances this is information they would have to pay for.
To your readers, this is a gesture of goodwill. It conveys that you are a highly ethical and moral organization to work with.
So how much can you really make with content marketing?
Continuing our example of the financial consulting firm, let’s say you hire an experienced content marketer or an agency.
They get to work.
They do some robust topic research, identify keyword clusters, ensure your website’s optimized to rank, and get to work creating content for the identified topics.
In about 3 months, they produce 15 long-form posts. After 10-12 months, you notice that 6 of those posts rank, and 9 don’t.
The posts that rank collectively bring in about 6k visitors a month.
Out of which a measly 1% contact you. From which only 10% convert to actual paying customers, so 6 people.
Now let’s do the math, the average invoice for a financial consulting firm is $5k (I’m not even touching firms that serve as fractional CFOs, that’s more like $50k).
So, if you’re invoicing $30k, every month (6 clients x $5k), you’re adding $360k to your revenue annually.
$360k…
For what? $10k – $15k to publish 10 blog posts. That’s a 36x ROI! I could be off by massive amounts and you’d still make money!
You can basically scale this to the ends of the earth, and steadily grow your business.
Why you should scale content to become a brand
Now you know, content attracts huge swaths of clients, and even with measly conversion rates, you’ll still knock out a stellar ROI.
But here’s the true power of content marketing.
Let’s say after the first 10 posts, you have more money available to you, so you go for 50 posts this time.
What you’ll likely end up doing with 50 jaw-dropping articles, other than making millions, is becoming a whole brand on the internet.
Once you have strong branding, your readers will recommend you to their sphere as the default choice for financial information.
This will bring you very “warm” referral leads.
Additionally, you will:
* Be able to charge premium prices.
* Have YOUR pick of clients.
* See more customer loyalty.
* Create barriers to entry for new competition around your niche.
* Hit the ground running if you want to expand beyond your niche.
With that, let’s discuss how you can create content as a business consulting firm.
Drawbacks to content marketing
Oftentimes, your blog posts will take upwards of 6 months to rank, so it is a bit of a long-term play.
The upfront investment is expensive, not everyone can afford quality agencies and writers.
It takes some work to weed out the good content marketers from the ones that are just going to throw chatGPT spam on your site.
Content marketing works better for high-ticket, remote services than volume-based, local services.
Conclusion
I say this with no delusion, if you’re a B2B service agency, you can make millions and blow your competition out of the water with content marketing. A 36x ROI through a single content creation effort is no joke.
If you aren’t already leveraging content, what are you waiting for?




My #1 tip for SaaS founders:


Invest heavily in content marketing early


By "content marketing" I don't just mean blog posts. I'd also include YouTube videos, Quora answers, Reddit posts, etc...


Basically, any content you create that someone can find via a Google search in the future. "Is it worth trying to publish my blog post on someone else's blog?"


If you already have a good relationship with the person/team who runs that blog, sure go for it.


If not, then I think it's a huge waste of time. Just publish it on your own blog and move on to the next thing.


The longer I work in content marketing, the more I’m convinced that SaaS companies publish far too much content targeting the top of the funnel and far too little content that teaches people how to solve real problems/do interesting things with their tools.


Founders, now more than ever, are looking to build personal brands through content and integrate these with company brands.


CEOs understand the value of authenticity and are excited to put themselves forward - accents, pronunciation errors and grammar mistakes intact.


More and more busy CEOs are setting aside *hours* each week to create content.


Automation and repurposing of content are important agendas.


Sample use cases:
>Webinars repurposed as video clips, blog posts, and social media copy


Podcasts and videos are now a way to bring your customer forward.


Sales reps, founders and marketers need customers to tell other customers about their product.CEOs are happy to hire partners to storify their thoughts and ideas — whether it’s through videos, blogs or interviews.


Tip for SaaS founders:


Don’t specifically mention your prices in your content marketing (blog posts, YouTube videos, Quora answers etc)


…because once you eventually raise your prices, you’ll need to update it everywhere


Content marketing is how startups won in the last decade but it's becoming a commodity.


The only way to stand out from AI tools and cheap writers is by adding personal experiences and strong opinions.


That’s the only thing they will never be able to copy.


Content marketing explained:


If your potential customer is looking to buy a swimming pool, you make them aware of your company by answering questions they have related to buying the right swimming pool so that they see you as an authority & choose you over your competitors.




Content marketing influences relevance.


Relevance means people talking about you.


This makes a content marketing strategy essential to growth.


Here are 7 tips to create a content marketing strategy that drives long-term growth


1. Use the topic-cluster model for SEO


The topic-cluster model organizes blog posts under the umbrella of a certain topic.


They all live under one page.


That page is a broad overview of the topic.


There, they hyperlink to more specific content under the pillar content.
For ex:


Topic: Paid Media


Pillar Content: Paid Media


Cluster Content: How to write copy for Instagram ads, A simple guide to launching your first ad, 5 Steps to high converting funnels




2. Pillar Content Model to Scale


Consumers want more content than ever.


With the pillar content model, you create a pillar piece of content (think podcast, newsletter, blogs, YouTube) and then create and distribute micro pieces of content from that pillar piece.


For example


Pillar Content: Daily Newsletter


Micro Content: Bite-sized pieces from daily newsletter distributed on social


Pick 1-2 platforms and figure out how to make that content, native to the platform.




3. Long-Form Content


Long-form content performs better in search engines.


Both in written form and video form.


Think of your long-form content as the one-stop shop for everything a consumer needs to know.




4. Repurpose Past Content


Re-purposing past content is a gold mine.


In this case, if you strike gold once, you can do it again.


For ex:


You wrote a thread 5 months ago when you had 2000 followers


It performed well.


5. months later, you have 7000 followers...So, it's time to bring back that epic piece of content, touch it up, and re-distribute it.


If it worked with your previous audience, then most likely the new followers will enjoy it too.




6. Original Content


Want to become an authoritative figure in your industry?


Research for hours and create original content.


That’s content that’s not published on the web.


Yours is the first.


Do this consistently and over time you’ll be a source for information.


7. Find Your Differentiation Factor


There are thousands of people in your niche, many with similar interests, but only one you.


Your differential factor answers “why you?”


Developing your “why you” creates an expectation from consumers.
Meeting that expectation repeatedly builds trust.


Trust influences retention.


Retention creates a reputation.


Find your difference. Stand out.




8. Test, Test, Test, Scale and repeat


Don’t develop a strategy and live and die by it.  It should evolve.


Here’s how I do it:


- Test content. Nothing.
- Test content. Nothing.
- Test content. It hits.
- -Scale what hits.
- Make it a pillar piece of content.
- Restart


Now, I’m in a position where I have a form of content that is successful 9/10.


Restarting the process helps me find another form of content that is successful 9/10.

What we learned & how we’ll apply it

Introduction
One of the many advantages of agency life is getting to help exciting SaaS startups that maybe
don’t have the time, the budget, or the headspace available for proper in-house marketing.
Imagine: You’ve got the product nailed down. Your USP has you brimming with excitement. The
world needs to hear about it. But they're not. And that can be painful when you’ve invested so
much.
Ever been there?
Back in 2019, a small SaaS startup with similar issues came to Digital Tailors for help. They
wanted to build their marketing initiatives from the ground up.
Join us in this article as we show you just how that went down, and how we took a new,
up-and-coming business to the heights of success and profitability.

1

4. Discovering the Client:
An up-and-coming SaaS that just got started
During our discovery call with the client, we uncovered some of the issues they had with
marketing at that point:
3.

They couldn’t scale their content creation efforts. Beyond a marketing agency, they
required a partner that could take ownership of content marketing and start writing
right away.

4. They had no dedicated marketing person who could be independent. Independence is
essential in the early stages of marketing. You need to be sure the marketing owner
understands and can start the marketing engine on their own.
5. Their website lacked organic visibility and authority. Scarce and poorly-optimized
content didn’t deliver any results - nobody was seeing their business.
6. They had very few industry connections. In a niche that championed the value of
networking, they were mostly alone.
7. Their brand was unknown. Lack of marketing meant their online presence was
practically nonexistent.

There were quite a few hurdles to jump over - but we’re always excited to begin work on clients
with new and refreshing businesses.
It’s part of what makes our life so fun at Digital Tailors, the opportunity to jumpstart valuable
startups and see them soar - there’s nothing like it.
But how did we do it?

8. Planning for Growth:

An integrated marketing strategy with frequent
client syncs
It was clear early on that just by publishing content, our efforts would be slightly wasted. Our
approach had to be multipronged:
➔ Content. We began by resetting their content efforts. That meant: plenty of industry
research, keyword research, new SEO articles, new pain-point-focused articles, drafting
new guides, producing social media content, and a lot of content updates. The first 3-4
months meant a complete overhaul of existing content, which led to better-ranking
articles that served as a ramp to boost all our other initiatives.
➔ Outreach. Because some of their articles were still good, we simultaneously launched a
genuine and non-spammy outreach initiative to build both connections and - while we
were at it - links.
➔ Distribution. We firmly believe in the 25/75 rule - meaning three-quarters of the time
spent on an article should be focused on promotion.
➔ Account Management. As our relationship evolved, planning, reporting, and support
became much more intense and constant. This was a natural side-effect of our
marketing tactics working. To compensate, we had to optimize all three elements to
save time and create a streamlined process that we could also apply to new clients.
➔ Extra Tactics. No matter where the initiative came from - Digital Tailors or the client we always had some extra things we wanted to do, so we made sure to secure some time
for ideas that didn’t fit into any boxes.

As you can see, results started to pour in within 3 months of us implementing our integrated
marketing strategy. Even though 2019 was only halfway covered by our team, by the end of the
year, we had already seen very promising results.

↪ Hyperfocus on Community Engagement & Relationship
Building
The biggest issue our new client had was the lack of an industry presence. That meant we had to
put in the work to start from scratch. How? Simple: outreach, social media, communities, and
more.
Our first goal was to generate social buzz with almost every post and especially with our
marketing launches.
Our second goal was to build a list of linkerati and influencers from the same industry as our
client. We then used this list to:
3.

Give actionable advice in an industry where we weren’t experts from the start

4. Generate authentic content that stemmed from real experiences
5. Boost reach & promo efforts by getting their followers to see our content
We were betting on the snowball effect of genuine connections. Both the goals and the tactics
we used to achieve them complemented each other. Think of it like this: if you create a
relationship with someone by, say, quoting their book, that someone’s likely to help you when
you need a standout chapter for your next branded eBook.
Every post, every outreach form, every email counts. That’s why we put in the effort to create
genuine templates that don’t look like spam, are easily customizable, and showcase our focus
on providing value for both parties’ audiences.
4

By putting content first & reaching out in a friendly manner, we managed to secure a guest post
for our client on this DA 70+ website after just two follow-ups. Now, granted, that kind of win is
rare in outreach, which typically has a success rate of 8.5% (meaning 8-9 in 100 emails get
answers), but we’ve found that being authentic in these interactions can significantly improve
that rate.

5

6. Gaining Perspective:

Snowballing brand authority with unique content
It’s time to take our initiatives one by one and demystify our processes - which were at times
very complex, no point denying it.
It’s the nature of SaaS and of startups: processes are undefined, teams are in constant flux, and
let’s not even mention the amount of product changes or shifts. As such, every task, recurring or
not, had to be iterated until we reached a functional status quo, then optimized towards our
goals.
Like all things marketing, let’s begin with a discussion of content.

4. Content Creation
Mixing Hot SaaS Topics, Pain Points, CX Trends
The recipe for SaaS content varies slightly based on niche, but it’s usually a mix of:
➔ classic SaaS topics (e.g. sign up flows, CSAT, onboarding)
➔ customer pain points and concerns (client and industry-specific)
➔ customer experience trends (e.g. customer loyalty, brand advocacy, customer service,
support, and success)
➔ highly technical content (optional & client-specific - some need it, some don’t, and in
some cases, there’s overlap with the other categories).
All with a cup of SEO to boot. That’s exactly what we did.

Website Page Views vs Blog Page Views - both showcasing healthy growth levels. Note: Blog subdomain

6

We began by covering the basics - essential topics within the niche that should exist on any
serious website dedicated to helping grow their niche (as our clients were). Soon enough, these
cornerstone pages were receiving some decent organic traffic - a good launching platform for
our more advanced content.
Moving on from there, we delved into customer issues by collaborating with sales, support, and
success representatives. Our goal wasn’t just to solve issues, but to also educate the client’s
audience on important topics and methods to achieve their goals.
Eventually, through our outreach efforts, we managed to gain some authority both for the brand
and the people, allowing us to publish expert op-ed pieces, fresh and informative guest posts, all
with an experience-based approach (we asked for quotes, opinions, contacted influencers, and
used HARO to bank on that all-important authenticity factor).

Guides and Extra Content Initiatives
These efforts eventually led to more types of content:
●

Webinars

●

eBooks and Guides

●

Landing Pages

●

Email flows

Working on long-form content marketing has been one of the highlights of our work with this
SaaS client. Throughout our marketing relationship, we wrote and launched three extensive
guides centered on essential topics within the SaaS world. Each of these projects included:
➔ The PDF guide itself, complete with an outline and SEO research
➔ The landing page associated with the guide
➔ The outreach necessary to gather expert quotes and opinions
➔ ProductHunt launches for every guide
➔ Supporting guest posts and promotional outreach efforts
➔ Social media briefs and materials
➔ Distribution to various industry spaces
➔ Constant, unlimited promotion post-launch
➔ Documents and presentations for talks (webinars, workshops, podcasts) on the same
topic or adjacent topics
➔ Video content to support the launch
The first guide was a lengthy process that involved a lot of iteration. However, by the third one,
we’d reached a steady workflow that allowed us to focus more on gathering exclusive, authentic
content.

7

By then, our network of connections, influencers, and linkerati was already taking shape, and we
managed to add:
★ 20 expert opinions
★ 7 influencer quotes
★ 3 influencer chapters
Needless to say, this also improved our promotional efforts (remember the snowball effect
we’ve been talking about?

😉) as all the quoted experts shared their work because they were

proud of it. As such, our reach saw at the bare minimum a 20-fold increase from our previous

guides (one for each person who distributed the document to their followers, not even counting
the fact that most of these people had a much larger following than our client).

Updating Content to Remove Issues
Content updates are essential to website health - both from an SEO perspective and a UX one.
One of the things we did early on was to make a list of top-performing articles and update them
as we went along.
Updates could be:
●

Short, weekly updates to move the article towards its ideal form and signal search
engines to recrawl older articles

●

Long, extensive rewrites wherever the content needed to be completely revamped, with
optional redirects and other code fixes

Social Media Content
Social media isn’t just social media for us. We made it a point from the beginning to treat it not
as a supporting distribution method, but as its own channel for growth, audience research,
and content creation.
Chief among our social goals was the client’s mission to educate & contribute to the growth of
the SaaS space as a whole.
As such, our social media process looked something like this:
●

We created content specifically designed for education rather than lead generation

●

We distributed that content in all the relevant industry spaces at our disposal

●

We used the same graphics in our articles and guides (with minor edits to align the
design, of course), therefore boosting the scannability of the content we distributed

8

The results? Our community posts regularly got consistent, high-quality engagement & spurred
discussions that led to even more connections and influencer relationships. It’s a never-ending
cycle of growth, once you start it - for every new cornerstone content piece we produce, we
scour the comment sections of our posts, looking for new people to reach out to and feature.

5. Outreach Initiatives
Sifting through the Spam, Writing Guest Posts All the Way
As digital marketing evolved, so did the traditional linkbuilding process. Today, spammy
linkbuilders are much better at spam, while new, genuine outreach specialists step into a space
so populated by spammy email templates that they can’t even find good ones, so they send
spam.
For our client, we had to pay close attention to even the spammiest outreach proposals on the
off chance they contained some hidden gold nugget. And more often than not they did.
After a bit of trial and error, our outreach process went something like this:

•

We created list type articles to both provide useful lists for our audience and attract
businesses that want to be on that list.

• We also sent those articles via email to people who worked for the companies we
featured, trying to catch their eye and begin a productive conversation on the topic.
• We sent outreach emails (based on our kickass templates) to a weekly updated list of
prospects, asking for opportunities, proposing genuine exchanges, and generally just
being nice.

9

• We published guest posts, social media posts, and other engaging content to build the
authority of our client’s Founder & CEO.
• As a result, we also received regular outreach messages via email, LinkedIn, and from
connections made in our regular Slack, Workplace, and LinkedIn communities.
• We asked for quotes on HARO & in our communities, proceeding to reengage with
contributors after they had provided a quote, showing them the result of our
collaboration in the hopes of furthering the relationship.
•

All efforts came down to several deciding factors: is this opportunity good for us? Is the
outreach request genuine? Is the website enough of an authority in the space? If the
answers to these questions were positive, we would proceed.

c. Brand Visibility
Making a Scene and Putting on a Show
Many of the outreach and content efforts complemented each other and helped us push content
to new spaces and new people. This approach generated “buzz” around our client’s business and
product.
Let’s review our content distribution efforts:
*

LinkedIn. For LinkedIn, we went with a three-pronged approach to distribution:
9. First, there were the regular page posts. As already mentioned, these were
educational-first posts, engineered to start conversations, not just get likes.
10. Secondly, we used those posts in various LinkedIn groups, with a bit of trial and
error over time.
11. Third and possibly most important, we used those same designs together with
some initial engagement boosting tactics for posts on the profiles of our SaaS
client’s founder and various other team members.

2. Facebook and Twitter. As a B2B business in the EU, our client did not prioritize
Facebook or Twitter, but we continued to maintain an active presence there as well,
managing to generate some engagement by just repurposing existing content.
3. Quora and Reddit. We put a lot of effort into growing the client’s presence on Quora and
Reddit and, despite the pitfalls of marketing on those platforms, we managed to get
their name in many of the most relevant discussions in their niche.
4. Workplace and Slack. At some point during our community-building efforts, we
removed unengaged Facebook Workplaces and Slack spaces, settling on just 2 that both
seemed ideal for our client. The result was our engagement actually increased after we
removed some online spaces from our workflows.
5. Email. As a distribution channel, email is difficult to do what with the abundance of
spam in the B2B space. However, we managed to gain both traction and leads through
several automated drip campaigns.
6. Other channels. SlideShare, YouTube, G2, Capterra, GetApp, Mopinion.

culminating with the most recent one in February 2022. Source: GA.

Now that the stage is set, let’s zoom in on some of our efforts & see exactly how we proceeded to
put on a show with our content:

Posts that Helped the SaaS Space Grow
As we already mentioned, early on in our relationship, the client made one thing clear: we
weren’t going to do social media the “traditional way”, i.e. focused on lead generation and
traffic. They wanted to contribute to the SaaS space and provide opportunities for that space to
grow.
The client’s approach fit in well with our social media-as-a-channel for growth mentality. As a
result, we prepared:
●

Educational posts centered around hot topics in the SaaS niche

●

“How to” slides related to the target audience’s pain points

●

Eye-catching designs explaining complex SaaS topics

●

Periodic industry review infographics

●

Side-by-side explainers of similar concepts in the SaaS space

●

Lists of podcasts / books / webinars / tools - (which also provided ample opportunities to
increase our reach, gain connections, start conversations, and further marketing
relationships)

All these posts performed to varying degrees of success. The best results we saw were on
Workplace, Slack, and LinkedIn groups where influencers and community amplifiers were
always on the lookout for posts that actually provided value to engage with.

12

The best moments were those when something we posted resonated with people actually doing
the jobs we were targeting in our audience:

Of course, not everything went smoothly. Many online spaces still have some bias against
branded posts - regardless of whether they’re providing value or not. Some moderators weren’t
as receptive to these types of posts and immediately removed them, while others (as seen
above) allowed them and thus managed to boost their group engagement.

d. Conversions
Before we began working with this client, the CEO made one thing clear: conversions are the
responsibility of sales. Still, like any diligent marketers, we took that to mean: we should focus
on educational content, but keep an eye on conversion optimization.

4. Getting Results:
What we learned & how we’ll apply it
Over the last two to three years, our experiments, initiatives, and recurring workflows with this
SaaS client have unearthed some unexpected lessons. While growth is to be expected over time
for any team, marketing is a dynamic field - sometimes you learn things one way, then best
practices turn the other way around.
As such, potentially the most valuable lesson we gleaned is this:

Never get stuck on your own ideas.
It takes a lot of courage to dismiss something you were once very enthusiastic about particularly in SaaS startup marketing. We’ve had platforms and communities that died down.
We’ve had types of posts that stopped performing. We even had outreach threads get to 12+
replies only for the collaboration to fail in the end. All these things had to be rethought,
scrapped, and our efforts refocused on what worked.
Beyond this, we can also write down some highly-specific tips. Let’s break them down based on
category:
-

Write blog posts under 2,500 words. Few people read articles longer than that.
Consequently, those posts perform worse in organic search too, because the machine
learning algorithms have adapted to serve what gets read.

- Send 5 follow-ups - it’s worth it. Many of the people we’ve reached out to replied only
after 3+ follow-ups, with some doing that even after 5 follow-ups. However, once you
reach 5, it’s a safe bet to stop. Also, might come as self-obvious, but you should stop
spamming if someone tells you to stop.
- Focus on a few channels. There’s a dream that every marketer has at some point of
launching something on all the platforms at once. We’ve found that that’s not just
unrealistic, but it’s also bad to attempt to tick as many boxes as possible just because
you want to. Instead, focusing on the main drivers for the client’s business can provide
far greater outcomes.
- Use SEO as a tool, not a strategy. The marketing space has for years been taught that
online content meant SEO content. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. You can
write blog posts that are completely keyword-free and have them perform well - all you
need is good distribution and diligence in promoting that article. Traffic might suffer,
but that leads us to our next point.
- True value is hard to measure. Particularly when you’re promoting a subscription
business, it’s difficult to know exactly where the ROI lies. For example, SQL email
campaigns often seem a drain on time and money. However, they’re worth it even if
your open rate is much lower than other campaigns. Why? Because SQLs are far more

15

valuable than MQLs. Think: a single reply can start a conversation that leads to a
contract bigger than your entire business.
- Authentic content works. It’s been said time and again and we’ll say it again producing great content that’s unique, experience-based, actionable, and graphically
appealing can have far better results than doing the classic marketing checklist of SEO
articles, outreach, and calling it a day.
-

The longer you work with a client, the more value you can offer them. Time hones
every marketer’s skills in the direction dictated by the content they produce. If they
produce content for a SaaS for over 2 years, they’ll learn all the ins and outs of that
business. They’ll also be better equipped to break down barriers, outperform
competitors, and smash goals for new clients.

We sincerely hope you found this SaaS client case study unique, fresh, and exciting - just like
we planned it. This has been our experience in SaaS marketing. And it can be yours too! With a
quick call, we can align our goals and teams, and get your marketing checked!

How to Develop a Holistic
Product-Led SaaS Content
Strategy
My 6-pillar framework and step-by-step guide to
developing a comprehensive product-led SaaS
content strategy.

By ​Victor Eduoh (victoreduoh.com)

Introduction
“​Web content strategy is a pretty​ well-documented space these
days, but the interwebs are surprisingly silent on
product-focused content strategy.”
Did you come here feeling frustrated for lack of a
comprehensive product-led SaaS content strategy guide?
You’re not alone.
That 1st paragraph is a quote by Shopify’s Lead Content
Strategist, Alaine Mackenzie. It shows she also felt the same.
No wonder, she continued:
“In my experience, while [developing regular content strategy]
requires the same core skills and systems thinking, [the]
arsenal of tactics as a product content strategist are vastly
different.​”
Alaine Mackenzie.
In order words, Alaine says to founders, marketers, and anyone
who cares to listen that:
Creating a comprehensive product-led SaaS content strategy
requires unique execution skills.
She’s correct.
There are misconceptions about what a rock-solid product-led
SaaS content strategy covers.

1

Facebook’s Lead Content strategist, Jonathan Colman, even
admitted this. In his viral presentation,​ B
​ uild Better Content​,
Jonathan said:
“Content strategy isn’t copywriting. Content strategy isn’t
managing writers. Content strategy isn’t content marketing.”
Jonathan Colman.
What then is content strategy?
To this question, Jonathan advised:
“​Design content as a system, product, and experience.”
And his definition?

“Content strategy is interaction design. It’s also
user experience. It’s design thinking.”
These expert opinions make sense. And the reason for this is
there for all to see.
At the core, driving a successful product-led business revolves
around oiling three pillars:

2

Code engineers the product. Design makes the product
appealing.
But, words are what sets the tone that springs these other two
pillars to life.
You want to know why?
Internally, your team may know all the dots connecting your
product. As this illustration shows:

3

But, what happens without a well-defined, ground-up content
strategy?
Users will see your SaaS product as a blurry object, and not
know where or what to click on:

4

Thus, words - ​I mean carefully-selected ones​, bring your SaaS
product alive. The following reasons explain why:
● They’re foundational in that they help describe and articulate
what needs to be designed, coded, or developed.
● They set the tone with which you communicate your product’s
value proposition.
● They help your target audiences make sense of that value
proposition in your marketing.
● And done well, they empower those target audiences to not
only take action and sign up for your tool, but enjoy its use.
If words, or content, give meaning and context to your product’s
entire engineering and design efforts, don’t you think it requires
a holistic, ground-up strategy?
It does.
Like you, I couldn’t find a step-by-step guide on this topic when I
researched. Hence, what follows is my attempt to create one
for myself (and you).
Fancy an exciting journey to develop an all-encompassing
product-led SaaS content strategy?
Good.
Here’s what I’ll cover:

Conclusion: Content Strategy Ownership

48

What is a Product-Led SaaS Content Strategy?
Starting with regular web content strategy, renowned content
strategist,​ ​Kristian Halvorson, defined​ it as:
A​ “plan for the creation, publication, and governance of useful,
usable words.”
Relevant to products, Director of Content Strategy at Publicis
Sapient,​ R
​ achel Lovinger,​ gave it more context.
In her words:
Content strategy is ​“[the development and] use of words and
data to create unambiguous content that supports meaningful,
interactive experiences.”

6

At the time I researched this guide, there was no content
strategy definition specific to product-led brands.
Thus, I scraped and pieced all I found to define it as follows:
A product-led SaaS content strategy is an overarching
framework that guides the creation, publication, and
governance of words to position a product, attract new users,
and support meaningful, interactive product use experiences.
Victor Eduoh.
My definition also comes from the back of words by Intercom’s
Director of Content Strategy, Elizabeth McGuane:
“​...though the work is founded​ in the product team and design
work, content strategy has an impact across the organization.”
Those words by Elizabeth is another reminder not to relegate
content strategy to the backseat.
Why?
Because it affects all sections of your product, including:
● The strategic words used to position and differentiate your
product.
● The words used in your​ c
​ ontent marketing​ and ad campaigns
to attract customers, and
● The​ ​copywriting and UX writing​. These give users a
meaningful experience, as they solve problems with your
product.
Your content strategy must sit nicely between all. And that
because:

7

● It governs the internal use of words with which different
teams across your organization describe the product (and its
features).
● Also, it directs its use across the customer-facing, external
end.
● I went ahead to create a framework that shows content
strategy’s position:

Using the SaaS content strategy framework above, you'll see,
step-by-step, how I develop holistic, product-led SaaS content
strategies.
By the end of this guide you’ll:
● Learn how to get deep knowledge of your product. This
directly informs your design team's UX writing, copywriting,
and product use cases.
8

● Achieve a genuine understanding of your target audiences and
ICPs (ideal customer personas). This informs your marketing
strategy, including PPC copywriting, content marketing & SEO,
email marketing, and social media marketing.
● Finally, you’ll see how to assimilate market wisdom (trends
and competitor analysis), which helps you position and
differentiate your product.
As you see, this framework has six pillars. They combine to help
you create a comprehensive product-led SaaS content strategy.

Six Pillars Of a Product-Led SaaS Content
Strategy
Based on my framework, an effective product-led content
strategy development hinges on six pillars.
But, developing the strategy itself only succeeds when there’s
buy-in from your entire organization.
It’s not something you can do in isolation.
And that’s precisely how Biz Sanford, a Content Strategist at
Shopify, said they go about developing one.
In her words:
“​Through all stages of a project​, content strategists work very
closely with designers, developers, researchers, product
managers, support, and anyone else who needs to be involved.”
The reason for doing this?
Sanford added it was critical to involve critical product teams,
as it helped to:

9

“​...focus on the hierarchy, flow​, and structure of information in an
experience, so people can quickly understand and use products.”
And why did I take the time to highlight this point?
Because when developing a product-led content strategy for
clients, I always get buy-ins from relevant stakeholders involved
in the product’s development.
So, as you jump in and follow this walkthrough to develop yours,
ensure to do the same.
Good?

e. Deep Product Knowledge (Informs 4)
In the words of Emma O’Neil, LearnUpon’s Senior Content
Marketer:
“​Product knowledge is a skill​ where your employees fully
understand and can effectively communicate with customers
about your product’s features, benefits, uses, and support
needs.”
Above all, she also added this:
“Product knowledge is a critical skill that your customer-facing
teams need...”​ to steer growth.
In order words, content strategy guides how in-house teams
describe your product and brand. It also directs how your
external, customer-facing teams communicate to customers.
Thus, to develop an excellent product content strategy, start
with an in-depth knowledge of your product:

10

Okay, you can start where’s okay for you. I’ll start here.
And I’ll follow Biz Sanford, Shopify’s Content Strategist’s advice:
Get input from designers, developers, researchers, and product
managers.
But it doesn’t end there.
Talk to the founders, executives, support team, and anyone
involved in developing and managing the product.
Become an investigator.
Query everything about the product. From the incepting idea of
the product to the technology used in its development, features,
and down to design choices.

11

Everything!
Start by meeting with each team individually. Then collectively,
arrange for a meetup where everyone can relate to each other’s
take.
Your first goal?
To get everyone sold on the importance of developing a
unifying content strategy. Secondly, to communicate how their
corporation will help you identify the words to bring their work
alive.
Once you get this critical, across-the-board corporation, you’re
ready to start querying them to get deep product knowledge.
What to query?
Three things: Why? How? And what?
Why

●
●
●
●

Why does the product do what it does?
Why should it exist?
Why are certain features being developed?
Why should anyone in their right mind care?

These questions boil down to​ ​Simon Sinek's ​"Start with Why​."
Here’s how Facebook’s Lead Content Strategist, Jonathan
Colman, answered their's:

12

How

● How will the product go about achieving its “​ why”​?
● How will the product’s path to achieving its ​“why”​ make it
look?
● How will prospective users participate in achieving that ​“why”​?
● How will users’ actions affect the ​“why”​ positively?
Sticking with Facebook, it goes thus:

13

What

● What engineering and design choices will facilitate the “​ why’s​”
while keeping with the ​how’s​?
● What should be researched to articulate the ​“why’s”​ and
facilitate the h
​ ow’s​?
● What perception of this product are you looking to project in
the market space?
● What are the product’s specific use cases?
At this ​“what”​ stage, you want to understand what different
teams are doing to develop the final product.
Again, as Facebook does:

A little caution as you proceed.
According to Intercom’s Director of Content Strategy, Elizabeth
McGuane, as you interrogate different teams, you’ll find that:

14

“​Your product is a mess​, and you’re using the same word to
mean two different things. People are asking lots of questions
about clarity and not understanding the basic system that you
have.”
This lack of clarity isn’t out of place. You should expect it.
It gives birth to your next move.
Piece all the answers gleaned from different teams into a
coherent, crisp-clear content system. Then, refine those
answers into words your entire organization understands and
can draw from.
Keep in mind that these refined words will inform your in-app
UX writing, product use cases, and copywriting. They ensure
you don’t lose the product’s voice and unique story.

This process helps you to collate words different teams use to
describe your product. In this first pillar, you want to assemble,
articulate, and lay the foundation refining these words.
And refining these words start with the next pillar: Your target
audiences.

f. Target Audience + ICPs’ Segmentation
(Informs 5)
The first, all-important exercise, gives you deep product
knowledge. You’ll know why the product should exist, how it will
exist, and what your company is doing to ensure it does.
Next?
● Who will it exist for?
● Who will care?
16

● Where will you find them?
● What key characteristics about them do you need to inform
ongoing product development? How would they help to better
communicate your product’s value proposition?
In order words, at a broader level, who is your target audience?
And on a more granular level, who are your ICPs (ideal
customer personas)?

No matter how much or well you know your product, you can’t
tell its story in isolation.
Do this, and you’ll be describing your product in ways your
target audience won’t understand.

17

You'll end up speaking jargon no one can relate with.
Thus, the task at this stage is to identify your target audience,
segment them as much as possible, and find their language.
Your goal?
You’re looking for words that’ll resonate with the people who’ll
use your product.
These words will help you refine the ones gathered from the 1st
step in this product-led content strategy framework.
They’ll also inform the 5th step: Your marketing message.
In the end, you want your content to talk about your product in
its target users’ language. You want to speak in ways that get
them to say, ‘​yes, this is for me!​’
But, you must do this without losing your product’s unique
voice.
Do a poor job here, and you’ll struggle to attract prospective
customers.
The reason for that?
What you do at this stage affects the effectiveness of your
entire marketing message.
Don’t know where to start?
No worries.
The amazing​ P
​ roduct Marketing Alliance​ team developed
battle-tested frameworks for navigating this stage.

Own or marketing a B2B product? PMA outlined a set of
questions to help understand your target audience better:

Even if it’s a B2C product, PMA got you covered:

[​source​]
Identifying your target audience is only half the battle.
To win the war, identify the words they use to talk about their
problems relative to your product. Using these words in your
content strategy is how to command desired actions in your
marketing message [step 5].
To find them, however, you must segment your target audience
and locate your ICPs.
Your ICPs are champions of each customer segment created
from your target audience.
They’re the core personas whose words you must infuse into
your product’s messaging.
Why?

20

ICPs come from thorough qualitative and quantitative research.
It reveals people in each customer segment who cannot do
without your product.
Again, the team at Product Marketing Alliance has templates to
navigate this.
There’s the B2B ICPs’ framework:

Want to save hours researching your target audience and ICPs?
Then, head over to the Product Marketing Alliance. Get even a
one-month membership, and you'll have access to these
templates.
It’s $24/month, and it’s worth it. (​P.S:​ I don’t get ANYTHING
whatsoever when you sign up). Although I’m​ ​an Ambassador of
PMA​, I’m only recommending these templates because they’re
worth their value​.
The goals to keep in mind as you go through this 2nd step:
● Understand your target audience in-depth.
● Segment that audience and identify your ICPs.
● Listen to how they talk about their problems relative to the
solution your product provides.

22

● Glean the exact words they use to talk about those problems,
and most importantly
● Blend the deep knowledge product obtained in step 1 in your
target audience’s words. Doing this creates a positive
influence on your marketing message [step 5].
The next step?
Ensure you talk in a way that’s different from others.
You don’t want your content strategy to produce product
messaging that sounds me-too.
You m
​ ust​ be different to stand out from the crowd.
And to do this, you need market wisdom.

g. Market Wisdom (Informs 6)
The subscription economy isn’t new anymore. Being a SaaS
company doesn’t make you unique.
Shopify’s Lead Content Strategist, Alaine Mackenzie was right:
A generic content​ strategy doesn’t get the job done anymore.
In short, as per ChiefMartec’s 2020 report, over 8,000 products
are vying for customer’s attention in the SaaS Martech segment
alone.
And by vying for customers’ attention, it’s only natural to
assume they all have a content strategy as part of their
go-to-market motions.

23

Even if your product was the best in its niche, you can’t win this
intense attention war with a generic content strategy hinged on
a better offering.
Anyone can build better features. Anyone can copy that.
You need to stand out from the crowd.
Your content strategy needs to tell a story unique to your
product and brand.
You need to be different.
According to advertising and copywriting expert,​ S
​ ally
Hogshead​, that’s how to win the attention war and drive growth.
In her words:
“​Different is better than better.”
Sally Hogshead.
But, to do this, you need factual market wisdom:
●
●

An in-depth analysis of your competitors, and
An understanding of relevant industry/economic trends.

As the illustration shows:

24

This stage of the process is essential.
It is where you study and analyze your competitors’ content
strategy and make sense of relevant market trends.
But that’s only the beginning.
You also have to blend in the deep product knowledge and
customer insights from steps one and two.
Doing this helps you to kill two birds with one stone.
First, it allows you to develop internal content governance for
your entire organization:

25

For example,​ ​how Shopify does it​:

[​source​]
26

Second, it lays the foundation for creating external,
customer-facing content assets like UX writing, copywriting,
marketing content, and others:

Studying and analyzing your competitors informs how best to
differentiate your product and its features (​part of step 6​).
Don’t know where to start?
In a LinkedIn post, Kyle Poyar, OpenView’s VP of Strategy,
shared how to generate competitive insights that go beneath
the surface:
● Win-loss interviews:​ Regularly interview folks who evaluated
you and competitors in your space. What were they trying to

27

solve when they started their search? How did that evolve over
time (and who influenced it)? What did competitors do to
shape the conversation and position themselves against you?
● Org chart teardown:​ Gather data from LinkedIn and job
postings to rebuild competitors’ org charts. This can help
pinpoint areas where they’re doubling down and also ceding.
Are they expanding internationally? Have they added Pre-Sales
staff to go after the Enterprise?
● Marketing analytics:​ Using tools like SEMrush, investigate
what keywords competitors own (organic and paid) and where
they’re investing to win. What’s your share of voice on the
keywords that matter?
It doesn't end there.
Examine relevant market trends (​the rest of step 6​). The goal
here is to:
● Understand how your niche, industry, and the economy is
unfolding.
● Identify the right words and content formats to help position
your product along with relevant trends.
Thread with caution as you go about this step.
Keep everything in sync with your product (​step one​). And
ensure it resonates with your target audience (​step two​).
Do you need help going through this step?
Myk Pono’s​ c
​ ompetitive analysis template​ comes highly
recommended:

[​source​]
Next up?
The part of your product-led content strategy framework your
end users and the market will see.
It’s the part that drives sales:

29

Before you proceed, ensure you’ve made sense of the three
steps, leading up to this stage in the framework.
Do this, and the three steps that follow take a natural course, as
they all draw from insights you’ve gleaned up to this point.
And it starts with the words you choose to describe your
product with.

30

- UX Writing + Copywriting (Draws from 1)
In-app UX writing and​ ​SaaS homepage copywriting​ are the first
things prospects see when they discover your product.
It’s also your first chance to get them into action, like trial-ing
your product or signing up for a demo.
It’s so essential to new customer acquisition that Intercom’s
Director of Content Strategy,​ ​Elizabeth McGuane, said​:
“That’s the thing we’ve iterated the most, and it really comes
down to Intercom’s mission. What does it mean to be
personal?”
She was correct, and​ I​ ntercom’s content strategy success
reflects this.
To craft excellent UX and homepage copywriting, you must
draw directly from your product’s knowledge (​step one​).
The next box to tick?
Personalize the copy for your target audience. Also, use words
that are unique to your product and brand and don't sound
me-too.
You do an excellent job here by leaning into insights gathered
from the 1st three steps of your content strategy
documentation:

31

Using this framework to navigate this step is in line with the
words of Publicis Sapient’s Director of Content Strategy, Rachal
Lovingar:
“​Content strategy is to copywriting​ as information architecture
is to design… [the] use [of] words and data to create
unambiguous content that supports meaningful, interactive
experiences.”
However, as you go about crafting your product’s copy, keep in
mind that people don’t read on the web.
They scan around and pick words that are important to them
here and there. Your copywriting style must consider this.

32

John Saito​ captured it well in his excellent article, “How to
Design Words.”
John said UX and product copywriting:
“​[Is]​ a
​ style of writing​ where brevity beats brilliance, and every
character counts. Writing interface text is actually a lot like
design—designing words for people who hate to read.”
And how do you ensure your copy addresses the fact that
people hate to read?
Switch from giving them what to read to using your copywriting
to tell a unique story about your product that resonates with
them.
Again, to be exceptional at this, you need to:
● Draw from the combined insights gleaned in the 1st three
steps of the content strategy framework used up to this stage,
and
● Use the​ ​product-led storytelling SaaS copywriting template​.
The product-led storytelling copywriting template guides you to
personalize your copy for different audiences while telling your
product's unique story:

so your copywriting can do its work.
In order words, marketing takes the wheel from here.

34

- Marketing [Content, SEO, PPC, Email, Social]
(Draws from 2)
A quick Google search for​ ​SaaS content strategy​ and most of
what you’ll find are articles by content marketing agencies.
These articles talk about “saas content strategy,” as though it is
synonymous with saas marketing.
It's not.
As you’ve seen so far, marketing is only a section of your
product’s entire content strategy.
But an effective SaaS marketing strategy relies on a
well-documented content strategy.
Look at it this way.
If content strategy is a car with different parts to drive traffic to
your product, marketing is the fuel and oil that keeps the engine
steaming to reach its customers.
Take it off, and you’re left with a car with no gas to create
awareness, let alone bring people’s attention to your product.
Thus, using my product-led SaaS content strategy framework
as a guide, your marketing strategy relies on all the content
strategy pillars up to this point.
And on a more specific level, it draws directly from ​step two​:
Your target audience and ICPs:

35

Reasons your marketing strategy draws directly from ​step two
are:
● The marketing channels you choose must be the ones your
target audience hangs out.
● For prospects to find your product, you must use words they
use when searching for the problems it solves.
● Finally, your marketing, be it SEO, email, social, or PPC, must
lead with your target audience’s language.
Does your marketing tick those three boxes?
When it does, you show up where prospects are, become
discoverable, and sound familiar.

36

But, your competitors would do these same things when vying
for customers’ attention.
So how do you avoid me-too marketing?
Create a new category your SaaS product will live in and
leverage the same to​ ​build topical authority​.
The good thing?
Creating a category or building topical authority doesn’t mean
new or more features than others.
Anyone can do that too.
It’s about the strategic messaging you wrap your entire
marketing.
To do this, identify your prospects’ needs.
Then, name, and project a value proposition that’ll resonate with
those needs.
Your product’s unique story must be integral in the formation of
this value proposition. And it should depend on its features to
achieve.
Examples of this are Drift (conversational marketing) and
HubSpot (inbound marketing).
The end goal?
As prospects talk about this created category or search for how
to leverage it, your product should come to mind or be at the
forefront of the marketing channels you play on.

37

As the below image shows, you can do this with the​ S
​ aaS
Content Topic Clusters’ Strategy, CTCS​:

As this image shows, top-level content marketing, be it for SEO,
email, PPC, or social, created to promote your product should
project the category you named.

38

Next, each feature of your product should have content
clusters.
These content clusters should address the exact problems they
solve in a way that connects to the main category.
When you do this, you end up using your product’s features as
pillars to support your product’s category. Also, you’ll have
articles, addressing relevant stages of your prospect’s buying
journeys.
And to create each cluster content piece, show (don’t tell) how
your product solves prospects’ problems.
This content execution process is what I refer to as​ p
​ roduct-led
storytelling.
It blends your content strategy and copywriting to produce
content pieces with outlines that look like this:

39

This content execution process transforms each piece into
direct customer acquisition tools (and not for accumulating
MQLs or SQLs):

40

With this process, irrespective of where you drive traffic to your
content, conversion can still happen.
Hence, you can save resources creating and promoting content
only where your target audience would find them.
Because, according to​ S
​ ara Watchter-Boettcher​:
“We don’t need more marketing content. We need content that
does more.”
Sara Watchter-Boettcher.
And that brings us to 6th and final pillar of my product-led SaaS
content strategy framework:

41

- Positioning + Differentiation (Draws from 3)
You can’t claim a strategic positioning, and it’s automatically
yours. Neither can you say you’re different from others with
mere words.
Positioning and differentiation only come as a result of other
forces at play.
In developing a holistic product-led content strategy, all pillars,
from deep product knowledge to how you craft your marketing
messages, add up to differentiate you from others.
If you don’t execute those five pillars well, you’ll not be different.
In short, as you see in the framework below, the reverse is not
the case:

42

You can’t own a differentiated positioning by first trying to be
different.
You must start with the basics:
●
●
●

Deep knowledge of your product
An understanding of your customers’ needs, and
Factual market wisdom.

You want to develop a holistic content strategy that genuinely
differentiates and positions your product for growth?
Great.
Start by knowing your product inside-out.

43

Next, dive deep into what keeps your prospects up at night
relative to your product.
According to MailChimp on​ ​product differentiation​, taking these
help you to know:
“...what makes your product or service stand out to your target
audience. It’s how you distinguish what you sell from what your
competitors do, and it increases brand loyalty, sales, and
growth.”
It doesn’t end there.
To truly differentiate your product with your content strategy,
get factual market wisdom:
● How do your competitors talk about their products?
● What relevant niche, industry, or economic trends should you
align with?
● And most importantly, how do all those relate to your product
and ideal customers?
Aha!, a prominent product management software, wrote that
when you adjust your content strategy with these questions in
mind...
“​Product differentiation [becomes]​ the process of
distinguishing [your] product or service from others. [As it]
involves detailing the characteristics that are valued by
customers that make it unique. [Ultimately], product
differentiation creates a competitive advantage as customers
view your product as superior.”
Remember, what attracts prospects to your product is first the
words used to describe and promote the product.

44

Hence, differentiation and positioning starts with choosing the
right words. And that’s because words are the first things
people see when they encounter your product:

It proceeds with crafting those words to form actionable
content.
Then, it ends by promoting that content with a strategy that
drives it to the right places. From there, it appeals to and
attracts the right audience.
In order words...
Differentiation and positioning come from blending all pillars of
the content strategy framework.

45

Doing this helps you to project differentiated external,
customer-facing content:

46

Conclusion: Content Strategy Ownership
Do you have an excellent SaaS product?
Follow it up with an excellent product-led content strategy
execution, and you’ll drive sustainable growth.
But even if you recognize the role of content strategy in driving
growth, ownership may still be a challenge.
Take Shopify, whose examples I’ve used throughout this guide,
for example. A Lead Content Strategist at the company, Alaine
Mackenzie, said:
“​My team has four content strategists​ in a company of about
800 other people. Hundreds of these people ship content to our
customers every day.”
How do you manage words and content strategy in such a large
organization, knowing the critical role it plays?
Luckily, Alaine shared how they do it at Shopify:
“There’s no way we’ll ever be able to keep up. So education has
become one of our most important priorities.
As hard as it is for a team of control-freak writers to let go of
the need to personally vet every word that goes out the door,
the best thing we can do for the team as a whole is empower
everyone to write their own great content.”
Alaine’s and Shopify’s process births two questions:
● How do you ensure proper content ownership?

47

● And how do you do it, yet still empower everyone to write
great content that’s in sync with your content strategy?
Use t​ he 1st three content strategy framework pillars​ to develop
internal content governance:

Doing this helps you identify, define, and outline words team
members can always reference when crafting content.
Again, Shopify does this:

Introduction
Attracting and converting people to your SaaS products is the
goal—but it isn’t always easy.
Are you tracking the metrics that matter? Building a strong referral
network? Catering marketing initiatives to the SaaS buyer’s journey?
The SaaS marketplace is increasingly crowded and competitive,
making it difficult to stand out. How can you push through the
noise to get your message across? And once you do, how can you
get those prospects to convert?
That’s where lead generation comes in.
Lead generation is the process of attracting prospects to your
business. Once they enter your sales pipeline, the goal is to qualify
and eventually convert those leads into paying customers.
But finding good leads and converting them affordably and reliably
requires more than just a great campaign—it requires a long-term
strategic process.
What you need is a well-oiled machine; a systematic process that
attracts and converts high-quality leads consistently over time and
follows a strategic process throughout the buyer’s journey.
With the right strategies in place, your approach to lead-gen can
help you solve the right problems, promote the right solutions, and
target the right audience through the right channels, every time.
In this guide, we’ll offer a step-by-step marketing plan to help you
build a highly effective and sustainable lead-generation strategy.

Step 1: Lay the foundation
Before you start generating leads, you need
the right foundation to target and attract
your ideal customers.
•
•
•
•

Align sales and marketing
Track the right metrics
Create buyer personas
Map the buyer’s journey

Align sales & marketing
Today, the customer journey isn’t linear—prospects can move in and out of
the buying stages and may need attention from marketing or sales teams at
different times.
That makes collaboration and alignment between sales and marketing
increasingly important. Sales and marketing departments should work
together to lead prospects through the sales funnel strategically.
Set marketing and sales goals that go hand in hand. Make sure each department
is aware of the goals and benchmarks they are collectively working towards so
you can align and combine your efforts successfully.
Identify where in the sales cycle teams will hand off leads and transition
prospects so that no leads fall through the cracks.
Failure to align sales and marketing results in missed opportunities, wasted
time, and costly inefficiencies.

PRO TIP: Create a sales and marketing service
level agreement (SLA) that outlines expectations,
responsibilities, timelines, and goals for your
cross-team collaboration so there is accountability
and a clear plan for success.

Track the right metrics
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the metrics you use to track performance
and measure success against your goals. In addition to tracking general
marketing metrics — for example, organic traffic to your website, bounce
rates, conversion rates on landing pages, and so on — you’ll want to think
about how to tie those metrics to more measurable target outcomes.
•

Monthly Recurring Revenue — The average revenue per account x the
total number of accounts that month

•

Change in Product Usage — The software usage during existing month usage during previous month

•

Free Trial to Paid Customer Ratio — Number of free trial sign-ups that led
to a paid customer / total number of free trial sign-ups during a particular
time frame

•

Demo to Paid Customer Ratio — Number of demo sessions that led to a
paid customer/ total demo participation during a particular time frame

•

Customer Churn Rate — Number of lost customers within a certain time
frame divided by the total number of customers you had at the beginning
of your time frame

•

Revenue Churn — Total revenue lost during a certain time period (usually
monthly) / total revenue you had at the start of that time frame

•

Customer Lifetime Value — Average annual spend x average length of
customer

•

Customer Acquisition Cost — Total sales and marketing spend/number
of new customers

Use KPIs to identify which
strategies are working and
what areas of your pipeline
need attention.
Learn how to track these
metrics in HubSpot.

Create buyer personas
DEFINITION: A buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your
ideal customer, based on data and market research on your existing
customer base.
The first step to building a reliable lead-gen system is to understand who your
ideal customers are. Often, leaders think they know who their audience is until
they dig into the data. Conduct market research and analyze your existing
customer data to reveal patterns of behavior and key characteristics. Persona
research adds a new dimension to understanding who your customers are,
what they want, and exactly what motivates them to act.
The most effective way to get this data is right from the source: your customers.
Use interviews and surveys to drill into what your customers’ biggest challenges
were and why they chose your solution over others.
These insights, combined with quantitative data such as demographics, can
pull back the curtain on the type of buyers you’re currently attracting, which
types of customers you want to target, and what their main drivers are.
You can then tailor your marketing strategies to your specific customer personas
so that your messaging is relevant, timely, and ultimately more effective.

PRO TIP: Document your personas clearly so you
have them front of mind when developing strategies
and campaigns. It’s important to refer to your buyer
personas often so you can consistently craft effective
messages that speak directly to your customers.

Map the buyer’s journey
DEFINITION: The buyer’s journey is the process your prospects go through
leading up to a purchase and their experiences as a customer post-purchase.
Before you can create strategic and targeted marketing choices, you have to
understand how your customers are moving through the buying journey. When
you know what stage your prospects are in, you can tailor your marketing to
meet their specific needs.

Stages of the SaaS Buyer’s Journey
•

Awareness — The candidate identifies a problem or an opportunity.

•

Consideration — The candidate becomes a prospect. They have defined
their goal or challenge and are evaluating different options and solutions.

•

Decision — The prospect becomes a lead. They are ready to make a
decision and have defined the criteria they need to make a purchase.

•

Retention — The buyer is a customer and the strategy pivots to retaining
them through great customer experience.

•

Advocacy — Your customer becomes an ambassador for your brand.

Your SaaS business differs from traditional software companies because, in
order to get a return on your investment in new customers, SaaS organizations
must optimize both customer acquisition and retention.
This is because SaaS solutions — which are based upon a recurring revenue
model — rely on revenue from continued use of service (customer lifetime).
The longer your customers subscribe to the service, the higher the return on
the investment. But if your customers are unhappy with the service, they will
churn quickly, and the business is more likely to lose money on the investment.
In fact, acquiring a new customer is five to 25 times more expensive than
retaining an existing customer.
Keep in mind, you’ll want to make sure you have a solid foundation in place
before moving on to the next steps. Next, we’ll walk you through each step of
the lead gen cycle with some practical strategies you can use to lead prospects
through the buyer’s journey successfully.

PRO TIP: Some tactics will apply to more than one
stage of the lead gen cycle. For example, you can
use content like blog posts to educate prospects in
the awareness stage but also to nurture leads who
are farther along in the consideration stage.

of attracting leads to your brand. Content marketing generates three times as
many prospects as outbound marketing — but costs 62% less!
Think about how you can apply this versatile tactic throughout multiple stages
of the buyer’s journey to inform, educate, and persuade prospects to buy.
Top of the Funnel (TOFU) content is high-level content geared towards
prospects who are in the awareness stage. They are aware of a problem they
need to solve and are starting to research solutions.

TOFU content includes:
•

Blog posts

•

Pillar articles

•

“How-to” video content

•

Guides and tutorials

For example, let’s say your company offers software that boosts employee
engagement. A TOFU blog post may address high-level pain points, such as
“How to reduce costly turnover at your organization.”
Middle of the Funnel (MOFU) content targets prospects who are in the
consideration stage and are ready to evaluate options.

MOFU content includes:

•

Long-form guides

•

Ebooks

•

White papers

•

Webinars

•

Blog posts

•

Customer stories

•

Case studies

10

As your prospects move along the sales funnel and consider a solution to
address their point, they’ll start looking for more tactical and in-depth answers.
For instance, in keeping with the previous example, they might download an
ebook that compares different types of employee engagement program models.
Bottom of the Funnel (BOFU) content is geared towards prospects who have
high intent to purchase. They are ready to decide which solution to go with.
This is the stage of the process that sales will be heavily involved.

BOFU content includes:
•

Product demos

•

Customer stories/case studies

•

Product video tutorials

•

Product pricing chart

Once buyers are ready to make a decision, they will be ready for content that
directly promotes your solution, such as a live demo or case study outlining a
past customer’s success story with your product.
The top and middle funnel content offerings are especially key in lead
generation where prospects will engage with your content and demonstrate
intent through downloading content and providing contact info like name and
email. Ideally, this content will answer their questions and prepare them to
think more specifically about purchasing from your brand.

PRO TIP: Good content provides value. It must
be well-researched, well-written, optimized,
and highly-targeted so that it is relevant to your
intended audience. Don’t be afraid to spruce up old
content either. Updating and republishing old blog
posts with new content and images can increase
organic traffic by as much as 106%.

Optimize your site
Search engine optimization is a crucial component of a strong SaaS marketing
strategy and goes hand-in-hand with your content marketing.
Today, many of your prospects go online to search for the solutions that your
business offers—how can you connect them with your brand if they can’t find
you? When 67% of all clicks go to the first five organic results, you need to have
a ranking strategy. All the blog posts in the world won’t help you if you can’t
bring people to your page.
This is where SEO strategy comes in.
SEO involves leveraging both technical frameworks and creative marketing to
make your company visible online to the right people. Some of its components
include:
•

Technical structure and usability — This includes page loading speeds,
link architectures, and navigation.

•

Keyword research — Targeting the search terms your buyers are using
and building them into your site and content.

•

Link building — Developing a strong internal linking network as well as
building outside links to your page from high-authority domains.

•

Content strategy — Producing content that integrates a strong keyword
and link building strategy and speaks to the needs of your target audience.

A good SEO foundation begins with keyword research. Keyword research
for SaaS can be challenging for companies that often have more technical
solutions (and therefore more technical jargon and keywords). Plus, because
SaaS provides a virtual service rather than a tangible product, service solutions
are also ever-evolving and being updated with new features—often making it
hard for businesses to keep up.
This is why it is essential to build a strong framework.
Keyword research requires a deep understanding of your buyer personas
and what they are searching for. When you understand the questions
they have, you can focus on keywords and search terms that are the most
relevant to your brand.

precisionmarketinggroup.com

12

There are several different types of keywords. But one of the most important
is long-tail keywords.
Long-tail keyword: Search phrase of 3 or more words that are highly specific.
Because of their specificity, they have lower search volumes, but that also
means less competition and higher intent so you can target your personas
more effectively.
For example, let’s say you’re trying to rank for “employee engagement
software.” A long-tail keyword could be:
•

What is employee engagement software?

•

How to use employee engagement software?

•

How much does employee engagement software cost?

•

What is the best employee engagement software?

Narrowing in on long-tail keywords can help you corner the market on those
search terms and develop content that is highly relevant to your visitors.

SEO for Gated Content
Gated content is any content that requires users to fill out a form before they
can gain access (like downloading an ebook or whitepaper). While it can be
an effective way to generate and qualify new leads, this content format is not
crawlable by search engines — so its ability to draw in new, organic searchers
via keywords is limited.
A good solution? Offer a combination of content formats that help you
accomplish both — for example, a keyword-optimized blog that is targeted
for TOFU searchers, followed up by a Call to Action (CTA) that leads to a related
content offering that is gated.

Develop a referral network
Word-of-mouth is the cheapest way to generate highly-qualified leads. Referral
leads convert 30% better than leads generated from other marketing
channels and generate 16% higher lifetime value. Your referral program is
key to turning customers into advocates for your brand.
So how can you build referrals into your lead generation system?
•

Delight your customers with a great product

•

Make it quick and easy for customers to share your product with
others

•

Motivate customers to refer you with incentives (like discounts or
free offerings)

The best referral programs tap into what your customers value most about
your services. The more you can delight your customers, the more likely they
are to spread the word—and the easier it will be to convince those new leads
to convert.

PRO TIP: Leverage the right platforms. Great reviews
don’t just have to reside on your testimonial page.
Use review sites like Capterra to get your software
brand in front of customers looking for solutions.
Capterra is both a directory of SaaS solutions as well
as a review site where customers can share their
experiences with SaaS products. Take advantage
by encouraging happy customers to write reviews
that will help influence prospects searching on the
platform—and don’t forget to showcase those good
reviews in your other marketing materials.

precisionmarketinggroup.com

Integrate with other products
Product integrations are a simple but effective way to find highly-qualified leads.
Also known as co-marketing, building integrations with other services has two
benefits:
- It improves your product by combining it with another service for greater
functionality and performance and
- It can fuel audience growth by drawing on leads from the other service.
Integrations represent a symbiotic relationship with another closely-aligned
business.
HubSpot does this well. They have numerous integrations with other apps
and solutions. For example, the SurveyMonkey integration allows you to use
SurveyMonkey data in HubSpot to segment and qualify your contacts. This
integration makes the SurveyMonkey data easier to leverage thereby making
their solution more powerful and effective for users.
Integrating with other solutions builds bridges to new customers by uncovering
and connecting them to relevant applications of your software solutions.

Step 3: Nuture
According to research by MarketingSherpa,
73% of B2B leads are not sales-ready. This is
where lead nurturing comes in.
•
•
•
•

Target content
Be responsive
Use multiple touches
Personalize your email marketing

Lead nurturing is the process of developing relationships with prospects
at each stage of the buyer’s journey and keeping them engaged in the sale
process. The aim is to listen to the prospect and provide the resources they
need when they need them.
Include the following best practices
in your lead nurturing process and
use past sales data to develop a lead
nurturing timeline that aligns with
your typical sales cycle length.

Expertise in lead
nurturing results in a 50%
increase in sales-ready
leads, along with a 33%
decrease in its cost.

Target content
Get laser-focused with the content you offer and share with leads. The more
personalized and relevant the content you provide, the more valuable your
brand will be to them—and ultimately, the more likely they will convert down
the road.

Be responsive
In the world of lead nurturing, showing up is half the battle. Be responsive.
Follow up with leads in a timely manner. Take advantage of tools like live chat
to engage prospects in real-time.
Research by Harvard Business Review found that companies that follow up
with potential customers within an hour of receiving queries are nearly
- times as likely to have meaningful conversations with key decision
makers as firms that try to contact prospects even an hour later.
Yet only 37% of companies respond to queries within an hour!
Not only does this represent an opportunity to close the gap with a lead, but
it also means when you take advantage of this strategy, you will automatically
set your business apart from the majority of your competitors.

precisionmarketinggroup.com

17

Use multiple touches
In today’s complex sales cycle, prospects require multiple interactions (or
touches) with your brand before they commit to a sale.
Increase engagement with your leads (and therefore your chances of
converting) by increasing interactions and meeting them where they are on
multiple channels (such as email and social).
Multiple touches, combined with responsiveness and personalization, will not
just keep your brand top of mind for potential customers, but actually help
you build a relationship with your prospects.

PRO TIP: Use automation to deliver tailored responses
when and where your leads are engaging with your
brand so you never miss a window to connect.

Personalize your email marketing
Email campaigns are one of the most effective forms of marketing—even more
so when you personalize the emails to your leads.
Personalization doesn’t just mean using their name (though that’s important
too). It also means strategically sending emails and other resources based
on the needs of your prospects. Your goal is to get the right message to the
right person at the right time. Leverage your customer data and build out
automated campaigns that trigger personalized marketing touches based on
actions taken.
Automate tailored responses and set up alerts tied to customer actions so
you can meet your customers where they are when they are most receptive
to your message. When you combine responsiveness, consistency, and
personalization, you can build a more authentic and relevant relationship with
your ideal customers.

precisionmarketinggroup.com

18

Step 4: Qualify/Score
Qualifying leads is about sorting through your
list of prospects to identify those leads that are
most valuable and most likely to convert.

This is an important part of your lead generation machine because the more
time you can spend nurturing high-quality leads, the better your chances of
landing sales.
The process of qualifying and scoring leads is typically two-fold. The first batch
of leads is qualified by marketing (these are Marketing Qualified Leads or
MQLs). Marketing sends these leads to sales.
Sales vets the leads and those that are considered ready for the next stage of
the sales process are added to the list of Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs) for sales
to follow up with.

PRO TIP: Automate the process with lead scoring.
Take advantage of tools like HubSpot Predictive Lead
Scoring software, which makes it easy to automate
and prioritize your leads across thousands of data
points.

Lead scoring ranks leads based on their perceived value to the organization.
Scoring leads can be a helpful process if your organization generates a large
number of leads and has enough data on your leads to determine quality.

precisionmarketinggroup.com

20

Step 5: Close/Retain
You’ve generated a list of leads, nurtured them
through the sales funnel, and they’ve been
qualified by marketing and sales. Now it’s time
to work with sales to seal the deal.

For seamless handoffs, automate and map out your processes wherever
possible. Keep marketing and sales on the same page by visualizing your lead
generation and sales cycle so you can easily follow leads through the buyer’s
journey. When sales can see each touchpoint and interaction in a lead’s history,
they can more effectively nurture the prospect to closed-won.
But remember: the journey doesn’t end once a deal is closed. In many ways, it’s
just beginning.
At this point, there’s a strong need to focus not only on customer acquisition,
but customer retention.
How much attention you give to these efforts may be correlated with the life
stage of your company. Start-up? Growth? Mature company? Consider the
following:

Companies less
than 3 years old
have a churn range spread
from 4% to 24% (Profitwell)

Companies 10+
years old
see churn in the 2% to 4%
range. (Profitwell)

So what’s the best way to retain your existing customers? Think
engagement. In your marketing materials, you’ll want to focus on strategies
to connect to your customers in ways that are targeted, meaningful and offer
ongoing value. For example:
•

Create a customer-only newsletters that offers solution tips, industry
advice, or announcements on new features that are available for your
SaaS solution.

•

Think about upsell opportunities. What does your customers’ past
purchase history say about possible future purchases? A lot! Use what
you know about your customers to let them know about supplemental
solutions they might be interested in.

•

Build a VIP customer portal on your website that offers go-to resources,
curated for specific customer industries/segments.

•

Make sure communication is a two-way street. Do you customers have
a way to know you’re listening? There are several ways you can make sure
it is, whether it’s through social listening, customer surveys, a trackable
ticketing system, or regular check-ins from your sales team.

precisionmarketinggroup.com

22

•

Measure customer happiness. Net Promoter Scores (NPS) are a quick
and easy way to see if your customers are happy. Also, don’t be shy about
asking your customers to review your product — and be sure to share
positive results with other questioning prospects.

•

Promote exclusivity. Give your customers access to exclusive offerings
and beta features that aren’t available to anyone else — and ask them what
they think!

Conclusion
SaaS marketing often feels complex, competitive and at times, overwhelming.
To stay ahead of the game, you need a strong foundation built on strategic
processes and best practices.
Use these strategies to create a successful lead generation framework to
acquire more customers, keep the ones you have — and enjoy greater financial
gains all around.

INTRODUCTION
There are as many as 2 million blog posts published every day. When you couple those with
thousands of eBooks and endless opinions of what worked for individual businesses, it’s evident
that the “surefire” path to success is ever-changing.
There is so much information available on what SaaS owners could be doing to grow their
business. So we thought it would be helpful to distill information from our experiences on a few
strategic marketing techniques that SaaS owners should focus on.
I wish we could hand you a magic recipe for marketing success that works for everyone. But the
truth is that there is no one-size-fits all solution. Each of the strategies that are outlined in this
book, however, have been proven to be successful for the majority of our clients. We hope that
you find them helpful and discover the right mix for your business.

When to Start Marketing Your SaaS
So, you have a killer idea. You’ve done your research. And you’ve built an amazing product that is sure to
drive people to subscribe in droves. Time to hit the press, right? Wrong.

ONE COMMON ROOKIE MISTAKE SA AS OWNERS MAKE
IS IMPLEMENTING A MARKETING STRATEGY TOO SOON.
SaaS companies are not ready for a marketing strategy until they’ve reached product-market fit. Your
business needs a solid foundation before you are ready to start jet-setting the growth.
Imagine you were tasked with creating the perfect
chocolate chip cookie recipe. Your favorite growing
up always included walnuts. So you set out to bake
your most perfect gooey, nutty, chocolatey recipe.
Everyone in your family loves it and your neighbors
do too. You are sure you have a winner.
You invest thousands of dollars building the artwork
for your nutty bits of delight and design a slogan
around the nuttiest cookies in town. But then you start
to sell and you realize that sales are slow. Feedback
is coming in that not only do many of your ideal
customers not like nuts, but half of them are
allergic!
Your time and effort could have been optimized by
following proper steps to achieve product-market
fit. Now, that’s not what this book is about. But it’s
important to note that if you’re not there, you are
not ready for this book. We have another book for
you to start with:
............................................................................................................
Pre-Marketing SaaS Initiatives: Working
Through Problem-Solution Fit

This is not to say that we think your product will sit changeless once you’ve reached market fit.
We know there are many iterations and improvements that you will make along the way. But the
foundation needs to be set first.
Sean Ellis says this foundation of product-market fit occurs when at least 40 percent of

your users say they would be “very disappointed” without your product. Can
you say that yet about your SaaS? If you answered yes, great! Let’s Read On.

The SaaS Marketing Mix
Optimal SaaS marketing strategies include a blend of general digital marketing best practices
combined with some strategies that are unique to the subscription world.

+ Customer Success

+ Content Distribution
+ Organic Outlets
+ Paid Amplification

+ Free Trials
+ Onboarding
+ Up-selling and Cross-selling

+ Offline Market Traction
+ Empower Delighted Customers
+ Employee Success

1: Customer Mapping
All marketing strategy should stem from a deep understanding of the values that are important
to your ideal customer.
IF YOU TAKE ONE THING AWAY FROM THIS EBOOK, IT SHOULD BE THIS FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH:

MARKETING EFFORTS SHOULD CENTER AROUND THE CUSTOMER’S VALUES.

REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. LIKE A MANTRA.
This may sound like a no-brainer, like something that they teach you in business 101. But the
application of centering marketing materials around customer values is where many
SaaS founders struggle.
Some owners make the mistake of composing their ‘about page’ with content entirely about their
individual story. Instead, the about page should primarily be about what the customer will get
out of their relationship with your brand.
Other owners make their information pages about the features of their products, when they
should be about the benefits that the customer will receive by using the product.
It’s these seemingly minor deviations, which are founded in customer centricity, that
can have a major negative impact on your marketing efforts. There are three steps to

understanding your customer to avoid these common pitfalls.

4

Research Your Ideal Customer & Their Values
Conduct customer development research to identify the values that are most important to your
ideal customer. This work can be done through surveys, social media research, phone calls, and
other means of outreach. Lincoln Murphy developed a very useful worksheet for Ideal Customer
research which he shared on Sixteen Ventures.

BOTTOM LINE, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS TO TALK

DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER AND TEST, TEST, TEST.

Some best practices to keep in mind:

+ Be specific with the information that you take down.
+ Record their language and dialogue.
+ Keep track of specific quotes, don’t paraphrase.
As you work through this information, you will note commonalities that appear throughout your
research. Find a process from a trusted source that walks you through all the important points.
The worksheet Inturact uses with our clients for building value propositions is based on the
book, Value Proposition Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want. Check
it out if you are looking to learn more about the value proposition process.
Complete the values worksheet while the data is still fresh in your mind. Patterns in the copy
will naturally appear. These repeating phrases are the language and benefits that resonate most
with your ideal customer.

THE CUSTOMER LANGUAGE AND VALUES SHOULD BE PRESENT
THROUGHOUT EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO GOING FORWARD.
Customer-centric copywriting will ensure that you have language-market fit throughout
your content. In other words, your product actually does what it says it does without being
misconstrued and those benefits are those which are important to the customer.

5

Define Your Marketing Personas
Personas are a fictional representation of your target customer. They put a name and face to a
cold demographic data set. And they help you build a personal, impactful marketing strategy.
Personas were made popular with the inbound marketing movement (which we will talk about
in more detail in the coming sections). They are essential to most digital marketing guides today
because of their usefulness in crafting more personalized marketing content.

THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. DO YOU THINK IT WOULD

BE EASIER FOR YOU TO SELL YOUR PRODUCT TO A
COMPLETE STRANGER OR A BUDDY FROM COLLEGE?
You probably answered your buddy because you know your friend. You know if they prefer
pepperoni on their pizza or veggies, and how they celebrated after they finished their last final,
and even the name they used to call their imaginary friend (eek!). In other words, you know what
they like, what they are afraid of, and what motivates them.

You can use this knowledge to your advantage when crafting your pitch. That makes things a lot
easier than going in for a cold sale knowing nothing about the prospects you want to speak to.
The concept is same for personas. You take all of your quantitative and qualitative data from
your customer development research, find the common threads, and build personas for each of
your revealed customer segments.
Give your personas a name, a story, and showcase their values and pain points. It can also be
helpful to include a typical quote this persona would say which epitomizes their feelings and
the goals that they are hoping to accomplish. Make sure that all of this information is tied back
to your data. Laura Klein rightly pointed out that many companies make the mistake of
building personas that are “descriptive but not predictive.” Don’t do that.
Ensure your personas are predictive and useful to your content creation by focusing on goals,
motivations, and concerns; and founding your information in data. There are many great
templates for personas online. Here is one to get you started:
A Guide To Create Detailed Buyer Personas

6

Map Out the Customer’s Journey
Now that you’ve got a handle on the values of your ideal customer and the personas you will
be focusing on, it’s time to map out the journey that they take from discovering your brand, to
becoming a loyal customer and beyond.
Traditional inbound marketing defines the buyer’s journey as having four stages: awareness,
consideration, decision, and delight.

SAAS MARKETING IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, HOWEVER,

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF RETAINING AND MONETIZING CUSTOMERS
IN A SUBSCRIPTION ENVIRONMENT.

We’ve identified five stages in what we call the SaaS Customer Cycle:

+ Attract (Awareness + Trigger): identification of a problem + early research toward a solution
+ Convert (Consideration): testing the waters - free trial, freemium, or demo initiation
+ Close (Decision): selection of the right product
+ Success (Retention + Monetization): overcoming success gaps to gvvet the
customer to their desired outcome so that they retain and increase their commitment

+ Delight (Brand Advocacy): moments of happiness with the brand that inspire
customer evangelism

**That’s a lot to take in, I know. But don’t worry - we’ll go through all of these SaaS Customer
Cycle stages in more detail in the sections ‘Content Marketing’ and ‘Product Optimization.’ There
is also a visual representation of the SaaS Marketing Journey on the next page.
All of your website content should not only be specific to a persona, but should be
mapped to a stage within the Customer Cycle so the appropriate call to action can be applied.
This will help you develop content with a purpose that moves customers along in their journey
and strengthens their relationship with your brand.
The formation of ideal customer value propositions, personas, and a SaaS Customer Cycle
are time intensive processes that are not to be taken lightly. But they can and will make the
difference between a mediocre marketing strategy and a winning one.
Once you have them in place, go get yourself a cookie (maybe one without nuts)! You are already
ahead of 80 percent of other businesses. And you are ready for the next step!

Visual of Complete SaaS Marketing Journey
Let’s take a look at the full SaaS Marketing Journey. This should visually help you understand
the different stages and the Goals, Strategies and Primary KPIs for each. We will dive into this
deeper and break down each section in the future. For now it is simply a great tool to help better
understand the full SaaS Marketing landscape.

2: Content Marketing Strategy
As mentioned earlier, SaaS content marketing strategies should always include two parts:

+ Potential customer acquisition (attract, convert, close)
+ Existing customer optimization (retention, success, monetization, delight)
Inbound marketing is optimal for customer acquisition in a digital environment. Customer
retention and monetization can be achieved with customer success content (more on this
shortly).

Inbound Marketing
Inbound marketing as a concept is based on the belief that customers would rather be pulled
into a product with useful information instead of having traditional, outbound calls and ads
pushed onto them.

Successful inbound marketing is achieved by

+ Developing useful content,
+ For a specific persona,
+ That’s mapped to a phase in the Customer Cycle,
+ In the language of the ideal customer.

There are numerous types of inbound content that SaaS companies should
be developing to ensure a robust marketing mix, including:

								+ Website content
								+ Blog content
								+ External publishing
								+ Email

							
							

Each of these is described
in more detail below.

9

+ Website Content
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, going forward you should continue to assume that
all of the things I said up until now remain constant.

h. Make sure your value proposition is present throughout the website.
i. Target content for a specific persona.
j. Map each site page to a stage in the Customer Cycle.

THESE THREE POINTS ARE MISSION CRITICAL
FOR ANY SITE PAGE, LANDING PAGE, OR OTHER TYPE OF CONTENT
ON YOUR WEBSITE TO ACHIEVE LANGUAGE-MARKET FIT.

SaaS marketing websites should have the bones of any good website but there are a few
important factors that are especially important to subscription marketing:

+ Optimize the Pricing Page:
If you’ve been in the SaaS game for 5 minutes or 5 years, you know the SaaS pricing page is an
important feature and conversion point of a SaaS website. This is because SaaS pricing pages are
a critical component of the Customer Cycle. They typically have at least three pricing tiers, with
specific calls to action to make the decision clear for the customer, and increase conversion. The
biggest mistake SaaS companies make with their pricing page is highlighting the features of the
product instead of benefits to the customer. To learn more about SaaS pricing pages, check out
this blog post, “The Top 10 SaaS Pricing Strategies.”

Value prop. Value prop. Value prop. Maybe if I say it enough, the value props will magically
appear like Beetlejuice! At least they hopefully won’t be forgotten (because many companies
miss this important step). The value prop should be front and center on both your homepage
and other prominent website pages.
Pro Tip: Make sure the primary CTA (call-to-action) is properly mapped to the Customer
Cycle. If your product is simple to understand you might have a Free-Trial CTA, but if it’s a
complex product it might be better to move the visitor to a ‘How It Works’ page to better
map out the journey for them. This will help the potential customer to understand the
product before committing to giving their info for a Demo or other offering.

+ Optimize the Landing Pages:
Your website should include landing pages for any event that is an important transition in the
Customer Cycle. For example, product description pages or free trial pages. A landing page is a
website page that has a form for collecting information from customer leads.

Pro Tip: Be sure to not include menu navigation or any distractions on the page that
could keep the visitor from converting.

+ Provide Social Proof:
SaaS companies often like to use the tactic of including customer testimonials. This is good
because it provides social proof, but customers know that you are putting your best foot forward
by selecting the best reviews. Take it a step further by feeding live app store or Google reviews
right on your website.

Pro Tip: Remember to choose reviews that demonstrate the typical language of your
ideal customer as well as product benefits.

11

+ Blog Content
Gone are the days that blogs are solely used as personal journals or digital recipe books. A blog
is an important part of the marketing mix where you can educate your customers at different
stages of the SaaS Customer Cycle, helping to move them along their journey.
It’s best to save the heavily self-promotional content that would help you close leads for landing
pages and other sections of the website. Use your blog for the following stages of the SaaS
Customer Cycle:

+ Attract
+ Convert
+ Success
+ Delight
The most common issue that marketers have with blogs is coming up with consistent content
ideas. Utilize keyword analysis, forum conversations, social media, and digital research to
identify strong topics. You should also pull from the data that you collected during customer
development about various pain points your customers face along the way.
The key to a successful blog is developing a consistent content calendar that is tied to
measurable objectives, and (you guessed it) is for a persona, at a stage in the Customer Cycle, in
the language of the ideal customer.

optimized blog post, including SEO best practices.

12

+ External Publishing
The best content marketing strategy includes content development for the business’s website
and content on other strategic locations. Guest posting on other sites with established audience
bases and similar target markets helps to build the authority of thought leaders within your
company, and by association, the brand.
Outlets are more receptive to guest contributors if an individual at the company has built up an
authoritative presence of their own. This is a great way to growth hack authority for your brand
as well. Some tips for building individual authority are discussed later in the section ‘Outbound
Traction.’

+ Email
You probably receive a lot of spam emails in your account, along with unwanted messaging from
subscriptions that you purposefully or inadvertently entered into. If you’re like me, you may have
even started wondering if email still has a place.
It does! Email is just as important than ever and a well-executed nudge or drip campaign can
make monumental differences in your customer conversion rate at the acquisition stage. The
key is to make the email attention-grabbing and value-adding.
Email can also be useful for existing
SaaS customers. Valuable, welltimed emails can help with retention,
customer success (see the next
section), and monetization.

13

+ Customer Success
A customer success content strategy is just as important to a SaaS
company’s marketing arsenal as an inbound marketing strategy.
We’ve all heard the old business adage, it’s more expensive to acquire a new customer than
retain an existing one. Nowhere is that more true than in a subscription environment where your
metrics are centered around retaining and upselling existing customers.
By default, customer success content helps with retention (renewals) and monetization (up-sales
and cross-sales) by educating customers about overcoming their success gaps with the product.
This is not to be confused with customer service - to which the goal is keeping customers happy.
The goal of customer success is to help the customers achieve the goals they have set out to
accomplish with your product.
Successful customers are not only more likely to retain, they are also more likely invest further in
your product through an up-sale or a cross-sale.

3: Content Marketing Distribution
Creating quality content is only a small part of the puzzle. It is equally important for your
marketing plan to disseminate your work.
In the past, content distribution was 100 percent organic in inbound marketing. But as the digital
landscape has grown and shifted, its become necessary to include a blend of organic and paid
distribution tactics.

Organic Outlets
Organic content distribution is any type of content traction that is
not achieved with payment.

Your marketing strategy should include a mix of:

Social media:
Share your content as well as the content of others. And don’t stop with just one post.
Post it across all of your social platforms, multiple times, at different times of the day.

Directories:
These are like digital phone books. Be sure your website is listed in any relevant
directories for your brand.

Forums:
People are engaging in these online communities more than ever. Communities like
GrowthHackers.com, SaaS.Community, and Inbound.org are great places to start for
the SaaS industry. Follow similar best practices for forums as you would with social
media accounts.

15

Paid Outlets
Your organic marketing strategy should be complemented with
paid campaigns. Some social platforms like Facebook are making
it harder and harder for your own contacts to see your posts
organically. Adding some paid media helps boost the work that
you’re doing to the next level and can move things along quicker
than organic marketing.

Paid outlets you should consider include:

PPC and Social Advertisements:
Paid ads to your content is a great way to boost traffic and conversions quickly.
Search and social signals from paid efforts can work to improve your organic
rankings as well.

Remarketing and Retargeting:
Follow visitors to your website around the web with display advertisements to remind
them of their interest in your brand.

Affiliate Placements and Content Suggestions:
Pay for product placement in venues that are closely related to your business. Also
consider sharing your product with solutions like Outbrain which adds the “other
posts from around the web you may be interested in” section to the bottom of
prominent posts and articles.

16

4: Product Optimization
In sports, the best offense is a good defense. In SaaS, the best marketing strategy is a welloptimized product. When we mention optimized, we are simply talking about all the areas that
help the customer achieve their desired outcome from your product.
All of the grassroots, feet-to-the-pavement efforts in the world won’t help you get leads
converted to customers if your product isn’t properly optimized. And there are a few important
areas on which to focus your efforts to maximize returns.

Free Trial / Freemium / Demo Optimization
There are many ways to allow your customer to get familiar with your brand and what you have
to offer while at the same time minimizing their commitment. Some of these include free trials,
freemium offers, or live demonstrations of your product.

It’s important to consider your market and industry
when choosing the best option for your SaaS.
Although free trials and freemiums both have the
word “free” in the title, they are not the same and
do not serve the same purpose.

A free trial allows potential customers to try the full version
of your product out for themselves. A freemium is a free,
reduced-capacity version of your product that is available to
people in perpetuity to help build awareness for your brand.

FREE
DEMO

There are arguments against the conversion potential of
freemium offers since they attract individuals looking for
free solutions by design. Many successful companies such as
Buffer and Slack, however, have built their brand off of their
freemium product. In the end, it is up to the SaaS to decide
what is best for their business.
SaaS: Free Trial, Demo, or Neither?

17

What most experts can agree on is that an optimized free trial is the best tool for closing
marketing leads that a SaaS company has. A free trial allows a prospective customer to
experience your full product for themselves and empowers them to make an educated decision
to sign up.
Now it’s important to make note of this term “prospective.” A common misconception in SaaS
companies is that the marketer’s job is done once a lead signs up for a free trial. This is far from
the case.
Successful SaaS companies understand that the free trial period is the time to put your best
foot forward. Free trial users are leads that are highly interested in your business, so much so
that they want to try it for themselves. In inbound marketing for SaaS, we call this a “marketing
qualified lead” or MQL.
Don’t make the mistake of turning these valuable MQLs off with a half-functioning free-trial
or decreased customer service. Show them what you’ve got and help them turn the dial from
“prospect” to customer.

Some ways to optimize your free trial include:

+ Offering full access to your premium product
+ Providing hands-on customer support
+ Utilizing in-app customer success messaging
+ Sending concurrent drip email campaigns

18

Customer Onboarding
Congratulations! You’re doing great if your business is converting leads into customers. At the
end of the day, that’s the most important thing, right? Guess what - the marketing team’s job is
still not done in the SaaS world.

The nature of a subscription business is to have your customers desire to stick around.
Help them help you by making the onboarding process smooth and seamless. A solid customer
onboarding strategy follows a lot of the same best practices as an optimized free trial. Educate,
educate, educate with in-app messages and email campaigns. Help your customer be successful
and they will love using your product.

Pro Tip: Check out these tools to help you with your customer onboarding:

+ LucidCharts - Map out the flow of the onboarding journey.
+ PowerPoint or Google Presentation - Visualize the journey by creating
screenshots of each step.

+ Inspectlet - View the screen of visitors and see how they are interacting throughout
the process to understand confusion areas.

+ Heap Analytics - Create event based funnels by clicking on actions you want your
users to take, and visualize drop-off areas in the process.

+ Appcues - Easily implement the onboarding processes that you have mapped out.

19

Monetization: Up-Selling and Cross-Selling
A third way to continue to market your product from the inside is to optimizing your
monetization strategy for the opportunity to sell customers up into higher tiers or across to
other offerings.
Much like the other practices mentioned above:

Up-sells and cross-sells can be optimized with strategic content marketing,
especially with:

Email Marketing

In-App Messaging

Find opportunities to showcase when additional purchases will help your customer be more
successful. Have expanded product offerings visible and don’t expect them to ask to sign up on
their own. Being proactive with a strategy is half the battle.

20

5: Offline Market Traction
The digital realm isn’t the only place for SaaS companies to gain market traction. It’s important to
get out into the real world and include some three-dimensional marketing strategies in your mix, too.
While there may come a time that your business becomes large enough for televisions spots and
print ads (I’m crossing my fingers for you), there are a couple of more targeted things you can do
now to build your brand.

Trade Shows
Trade shows are a great way to get out and communicate with prospective and existing
customers. The key is to pick events that your target market will join as an attendee. For
example, SaaS events such as SaaStr are great for networking and learning from other SaaS
companies, but if your business isn’t to sell to SaaS companies, it’s obviously not the best place
for you to have a booth.
Find out what types of events your customers go to and make your presence known. If you are
investing in a booth, be sure to take advantage of every opportunity to increase the foot traffic
to your area.

Pro Tip: Some best practices to increase booth traffic include:

+ Interactive offerings - Games, trivia, and other fun offerings are not only a great
way to drive traffic, but they also provide an opening for your sales team to
communicate with the attendees.

+ Giveaways - A well-targeted giveaway provides you with an opportunity to collect
email addresses from the attendees.

+ Personalized social media interaction - Jumping on the event hashtag and
interacting with attendees will show the human side of your brand and help to
build brand awareness.

+ Live blogging - Your business can add extra value for attendees by

recapping useful content or providing other educational tips for the event.

21

Growing an Influencer Status
Another way to grow your company’s brand is by cultivating an influencer status for yourself or
some of your employees. People like to see a face behind a brand; and outwardly showcasing
your expertise on a topic is a great way to build trust.
Of course, nowadays with social media, blogging, and guest posting opportunities readilyavailable, a large part of influencer building can be done with your online presence. But before
you zing me for including this point in offline methods - I would argue that the offline portions
are even more important.

Building the perception of an individual as an influencer is skyrocketed by two things:

Speaking Engagements

Authorship (as in actual books)

Public speaking on a topic is a way to demonstrate that others are pulling you in as a thought
leader (as opposed to you just self-proclaiming to be). And books are another tried and true way
to take your influencer status to the next level.

22

6: Empower Delighted Customers
Customer testimonials are one of the most powerful psychological triggers marketers can
utilize. When customers are successful with your product, and happy with your service (two
separate things, remember), their personal or professional lives will improve at your hands.

Give these customers a reason to spread the word.
Delight them with the interactions that they
experience with your brand. This can be as simple as
providing helpful tips at the times that they are most
needed, or going the extra mile with personalized
social media interactions that show you care.

While you may have many happy customers, the percentage of people who are likely to share
information online is small - the eighty / twenty rule applies here. Find these people and give
them calls to action to share their story. And don’t be afraid to reward the ones who do. You can
create brand advocates for life with just a few tokens of appreciation.
Customer advocacy has an impact on your bottom line too. You will see an inherent decrease in
your costs to acquire customers (CAC) and an increase in your overall customer lifetime value
(LTV) if your customers are helping to spread the word for you.

23

7: Employee Success
Last, but definitely not least, never underestimate the marketing sway of your people. They are
your army on the ground. The front lines of your business. And it often takes just one interaction
with an employee for a customer to form a perception of your brand.
As we move further and further into a world where transparency is favored in business, it’s your
job to empower your employees to be successful at promoting your brand, too.
Part of your marketing strategy should be to give your employees the tools they need to
promote your brand effectively:

Draft an elevator pitch for the company.v
Make sure it utilizes the language and insights from the Customer
Mapping section of the book and hand it out to all of your employees.

Define the best practices for your employee’s
personal social media accounts.
Tell them how much time you want them spending on their personal Twitter,
LinkedIn, and industry forums to spread the word of your brand. Their social
interactions are good for you - help them to feel that they are not only
allowed but encouraged!

Open the door to creativity.
Give employees plenty of opportunities to contribute their ideas so that they will
feel invested in the brand and prideful about where they work.

Build a kick-SaaS business - but that is a topic for another eBook!

8: Grow Your SaaS with Strategic Marketing
There you have it. Implementing these seven strategies into your SaaS marketing mix is
guaranteed to give you results. The time-line, ratio, and budgets are the points that vary and will
be important for you to determine.

Introduction
There are over 23,897 SaaS companies in the world right now, according to the
data from Crunchbase.

Last year alone, there were about 389 new SaaS startups.

What does this mean?

On average, a brand new startup joins the pool of existing SaaS companies
worldwide every day.

This shows that the SaaS business model is becoming more popular. Hence, the
competition for audience attention and sales will never remain the same.

On Capterra, there are over 700 software categories as we speak.

The same scenario is also playing out on G2, a popular software review website.

From popular categories such as CRM software, project management software,
marketing automation software, etc. To less known categories such as church
software, dental practice software, massage therapy software, pawnshop software,
etc.

The fact is…

There’s a SaaS product for anything you can think of.

And if you’re a SaaS founder or marketer, you should rethink how you market
your software to your target audience. Else, the huge competition out there will
consume you.

And guess what?

There’s no better way (at least for now) to communicate the benefits of your product
to your prospects and get paying customers without doing content marketing.

Tactic 1: Show Readers How Your Product Works
Without Being Salesy
One of the primary reasons to invest in content marketing is to educate and show
your audience how your SaaS product works.

That way, they can know its various use cases, reducing their learning curve once
they decide to try it out.

Truth is…

There are many features that your SaaS product has that your customers aren’t
aware of.

If you don’t show them how powerful and effective your product is, they might
sign up with a competitor instead.

This is why I recommend that every SaaS startup should leverage product-led
content marketing.


What Really is Product-led Content Marketing?
Product-led content marketing involves creating content pieces that address your
audience’s pain points and showing them exactly how to solve those using your
SaaS product.

With product-led content, you target keywords where you can weave in your
product as a solution to a specific problem that your audience has.

Here is an example of a SaaS company leveraging this strategy to grow.

How Ahrefs is Dominating The Competitive SEO Industry With Product-led Content
Marketing

Ask any content marketer or SEO expert around you, and they’ll tell you how they
enjoy reading the Ahrefs blog.

Here is why...

It’s one of the most helpful and actionable blogs out there.

Also, they excel at promoting their product in each blog post.

Take this post about Quora Marketing, for example.

The target audience for that topic is marketers who want to level up their
engagement on Quora and get better results from using the platform.

And one of the challenges they will most likely have is identifying good questions
to answer.

And guess what?

In the blog post, Ahrefs promoted one of its core features as a great way to find
these questions.

If you’re a marketer who has never used Ahrefs before and have this challenge,
you’ll most likely be curious about the Site Explorer feature and willing to try it out.

If you’re an existing customer who faces this challenge, you’ll want to check the
feature out.

Here’s another example…

If you build links for yourself or clients, you know how complex broken link building
can be.

One of the biggest challenges that SEOs have with this tactic is identifying broken
link building opportunities.

So in this guide about broken link building, Ahrefs mentioned this and suggested
its tool as the best solution for it.




They even go a step further to share how you can find expired domains with links.

As you can see, Ahrefs uses product-led content to show its audience how effective
its product is for identifying broken links.

By doing this, any potential user knows exactly how this works even before trying
the product out. Likewise, it’s a great way to keep their existing customers and
show them how powerful their product is.

In a recent Twitter thread, the CMO of Ahrefs, Tim Soulo, highlighted the ROI of


- Tactic 1: Show Readers How Your Product Works Without Being Salesy            Your Content Mart
Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/


investing in product-led content for the company.

According to him, here are some results product-led content has generated so far
for them.

- Brings in new customers

- Improves the retention of existing customers

- Re-activate past customers

- Helps with revenue expansion

- Fuels the word of mouth

- Leads to the “Mere Exposure Effect”

- Helps build a solid reputation in the industry

- Fuels paid acquisition strategies

- Reduces support requests


How Exactly Do You Write Product-led Content for a SaaS brand?
Dr. Fio Dossetto (Founder, Content Folks) recommends three methods for writing
product-led content. These include:

- Keyword-based method: This entails finding relevant keywords for your
SaaS product, applying the 0-3 impact score to determine if your product
can be mentioned in the content, and adding your unique angle.

- Customer-based method: This involves interviewing your SaaS customers
to know the exact features they’re using in your product. Afterward, you can
find an angle and a keyword to optimize it for.

- Existing content method: In this case, you need to look at your successful
pieces based on some predetermined metrics and apply the business score

to see how you can add your product to the content. Finally, you edit the
content before hitting publish.

Tactic 2: Acquire Freemium and Free Trial Users
Directly From SEO Articles
Most SaaS startups target top-of-the-funnel content that drives traffic without
considering bottom of the funnel content that increases conversions and has a
direct impact on the revenue.

Truth is…

Except you’re a big-name SaaS brand, generating tons of traffic without conversions
won’t help grow your business. People who click on and read your top-of-the-
funnel content most likely don’t have a problem your software solves.

Of course, generating traffic is a metric that shows you’re doing something right.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t translate to business success in most cases.

So, what exactly can you do to drive more conversions with your content?


Enter Pain Point Content Marketing
Pain-point content marketing focuses on the problems that keep your prospects
awake at night. In most cases, the keywords have low search volume in SEO tools
but have the potential to drive a lot of business for you.

When thinking of pain-point content, you must put yourself in the same shoe as
your ideal prospect who is about to make a buying decision. In most cases, people
don’t buy things immediately. Instead, they go through a lot of back and forth
thought processes before doing so. And in most cases, this involves doing much
research.

Say, for instance, prospect A has heard great things about Salesforce and wants to
become one of their customers. Do you think they’ll pull out their credit card and
make a purchase? Of course, in an ideal world, that’s possible but rarely happens.

Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/


So, what do you think this prospect will do first?

They’d most likely check Google for things like:

- Salesforce competitors

- Alternatives to Salesforce

- Salesforce pricing

- Salesforce vs. Hubspot

- Best CRM software

- Salesforce reviews

And in most cases, the information from this search will influence their decision.

Here’s where the opportunity lies for you as a SaaS business.

When you create pain-point content and rank high on Google for these keywords,
you’d drive tons of targeted traffic, which directly impacts conversions.

And the best part…

Most of your competitors might not be doing this already, so it’s an undermined
goldmine you should leverage.

Here is an example of a SaaS startup using this content type to compete and
dominate its niche.


How Chanty Took on Slack and Other Competitors Using Pain-
Point Content
Chanty is a team communication and collaboration software. It helps business
owners and their team members communicate and collaborate effectively to
complete their tasks. One of their biggest competitors is Slack, which Salesforce
recently acquired.

When you mention team communication and collaboration, Slack is the first name
that many people remember. So, how exactly can a smaller competitor like Chanty
become known in a Slack-dominated market like this?

The Chanty team leveraged the power of pain-point content and ranked for Slack-
related keywords on Google.

For instance, if you Google “slack alternatives,” they’re currently ranking on the
number 2 spot in the SERPs after Hubspot.




When you Google “slack pricing,” they rank number 3 after Slack.

Here, they provide factual information about Slack and why they are one of the
most successful SaaS businesses in the world. Then, they highlight the biggest
problem most teams have with Slack, which is the price.

Afterward, they mentioned why they’re interested in Slack pricing, with a quick
call to action to try out their software.

They also use this strategy for other competitors aside from Slack.

If you Google “skype alternatives,” you’ll see that Chanty ranks number 3 on the
SERPs for that keyword.

That’s not all…

They also target broad keywords related to their industry. For example, the
company ranks number 2 after Zapier for the keyword “best team chat apps.”

Here are some other competitors related keywords they’re ranking for:
- Ranking number 2 in the SERPs for Discord vs. Slack
- Ranking number 1 in the SERPs for Asana vs. Slack
- Ranking number 1 in the SERPs for Slack vs. Microsoft teams
And the best part…
These pages drive targeted traffic and rank for tons of keywords on Google.
Take the “slack alternative” keyword as an example. According to Ahrefs, it
currently brings in an estimated 1,200 organic traffic visitors per month and ranks
for about 1,700 keywords.

As you can see, Chanty has dominated the SERPs for these pain-point keywords in
the team collaboration niche.

This makes them top of mind for businesses that want to ditch their biggest
competitors.


What do SaaS brands stand to gain business-wise by creating
Pain-Point Content?
Expert Insight by Josh Spilker, Head of Marketing, Friday

“You can fast track the content marketing process because you’re meeting an
immediate need. Sometimes the keywords with the highest volume don’t have a lot
of buying intent. Pain point keywords and bottom-funnel keywords may not always
have the best search volume, but indicate a higher level of interest and intent.”

Tactic 3: Earn High-quality Backlinks Without
Begging For Them
Links are the currency of the internet. The more links you have, the more
authoritative your SaaS website is in the eyes of Google. In fact, Google’s Partner
Development Manager, Andrey Lipattsev, stated that links are one of the top three
ranking factors in Google’s algorithm.

Many SEO industry researches have shown a correlation between the number of
backlinks a page has and its ranking on Google.

In its study of over 1 billion pages in its dataset, Ahrefs found out that pages with
more referring domains linking to them get more organic search traffic.

Also, in its analysis of over 11.8 million Google search results, Backlinko found
out that the number 1 result for each query on Google has about four times more
backlinks than number 2-10 results.

As you can see, backlinks are uber-important if you want to build an authoritative
website in your niche and make SEO a growth channel for your SaaS startup.


So, How Exactly Do You Get Backlinks As a SaaS Startup?
You can get backlinks by either building or earning them.

To build backlinks, you need to reach out to website owners and bloggers in your
niche to link to you. On the other hand, earning backlinks is when people decide
to link to your page because they found it valuable and believe that it’ll be helpful
for their readers.

While it’s fine to be building backlinks, you should also aim to earn backlinks
naturally.

When you earn backlinks, people will link to you without any form of outreach, in

most cases.

Building backlinks requires sending cold emails and making people see reasons
why they should link to you and incentivizing them to do so.


What Does It Take To Earn Backlinks?
Take a look at the two websites I linked to recently; what do they have in common?

You can see that they’re articles that buttress my point about the importance of
backlinks with relevant data and statistics. And I’m sure many websites link to
them too for the same reason.

And the best part…

They didn’t do any form of outreach before I linked to them.

This means that if you want to earn backlinks for your SaaS startup, you should
invest in data-driven content.

This type of content involves conducting research, studies, analysis, and surveys
and presenting your findings to your audience.

Apart from helping you to earn backlinks, it’s an excellent way to show your readers
that you’re an authority in your niche. It also gives you insights into the challenges
in your industry and how you can help your audience solve them.

Here are some examples to show you how this type of content works.


How Buffer Earns Thousands Of Backlinks With Its Annual State
of Remote Work Report
In 2017, Buffer released its first state of remote work report. This has become an
annual tradition for the company as it collaborates with other top players in the
SaaS niche to release this in-depth report.



- Tactic 3: Earn High-quality Backlinks Without Begging For Them                Your Content Mart
Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/




Each year, the report generates tons of backlinks for Buffer.

Take the 2020 state of remote work report as an example. According to Ahrefs, it
generated over 5,000 backlinks from more than 2000 referring domains.

And the best part, most of these backlinks (78% to be precise) are dofollow.




A handful of these backlinks are from authoritative websites such as Forbes, BBC,
Weforum, Entrepreneur, Search Engine Journal, The Balance Careers, and so on.

From publishing one data-driven report alone, Buffer was able to get thousands of
websites to link to it. Even if most of the people who visit Buffer from this report
don’t convert to trial signups and customers, the links will bolster their website’s
overall domain authority and help them rank high on Google for competitive
keywords.


How Nextiva Generated Thousands of Backlinks With a Statistics
Page
In the case of Buffer, they relied on raw data from surveying over 3000 remote
workers to develop its report. While this might be the case for Buffer, not every
SaaS startup will have access to this kind of data.

This is why this example from Nextiva is interesting.


- Tactic 3: Earn High-quality Backlinks Without Begging For Them                Your Content Mart
Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/


Instead of creating data-driven content from a large pool of data, they curated
already available information on the internet.

Take a look at this customer service statistics page from Nextiva, and you’ll see
that the over 100 statistics cited in the content aren’t original data from them.

What they did was to source these statistics from authoritative websites such as
Microsoft, Forrester, Statista, Accenture, Ameyo, AE, etc., and put them together
as a post.

Nextiva has generated over 2,700 backlinks from about 1,200 referring domains
from this statistics page alone.




Not only that, this page ranks for about 2000 keywords and brings in about 445
organic traffic visitors every single month.

Here is the thing...

If you want to earn backlinks at scale for your SaaS startup and increase your
domain authority, you should leverage data-driven content.


How Exactly Do You Conduct Surveys for a SaaS brand?
[Expert Insight by Michelle Lynn, Co-founder of Mantis Research]

“Here is the general process I suggest you follow when conducting your own
survey for content:

Step 1: Make sure you have the right mindset. Remember: You are trying to test a
hypothesis, not prove something. You never want your research to point to your


- Tactic 3: Earn High-quality Backlinks Without Begging For Them                Your Content Mart

product/service as the magic solution. Instead, think about the questions people
in your industry are looking to answer with data and answer those questions as
honestly as possible.

Step 2: Determine what success looks like. Are you trying to build authority?
Generate leads? Get press? Something else?

Step 3: Decide on the focus of your research. Choose something meaningful to
your audience, aligns with your audience, and studies something new. (You don’t
want to repeat something that has already been done!)

Step 4: Determine how you will get responses. You essentially have three options:
your list, a partnership, or a panel. You can read more about each of these here.

Step 5: Decide who you want to take your survey and who you want to disqualify.
Disqualifying respondents is important because you want to make sure that the
right people are participating -- even if this results in fewer responses.

Step 6: Document the demographic questions you want to ask. For a consumer-
based study, this includes gender, location, and age/generation. When surveying
B2B respondents, you may want to ask about industry, company size, role, and
years of experience.

Step 7: Write your survey questions. There is a lot more that can be said about
this step, but to keep things simple, remember that you need to be as clear as
possible.

Step 8: Build in quality checks. These are questions you can ask to verify that the
right people are answering your survey and paying attention. While there is much
more that can be said about this step, remember always to ask at least one write-
in question.

Step 9: Program, test, and launch your survey.

Step 10: Clean your data. Yes, this may mean removing responses, but this is
important if you want quality data. If you are using a panel, they should backfill
any bad responses for you.

Step 11: Analyze the data and pull out the stories.”

Tactic 4: Write Content That Cuts Through The
Noise
If you were to search Google for any keyword, you’d find that most of the pages
ranking on the SERPs are writing almost the same thing. And finding a distinguishing
factor among them is a herculean task.

I love the way Ryan Law, the Director of Marketing at Animalz, puts it in this post
about Copy Cat Content:

“In chasing search traffic, companies are sleep-walking into intellectual plagiarism.
They’re fixating on their keyword research tools and SEO briefs at the expense of
originality and personality. They’re curating other people’s work instead of creating
their own. They’re choosing to make content longer instead of better.”

Regurgitated content can help you rank for high-volume keywords and even
dominate the SERPs. That said, it’s challenging to build a fanbase who will find
your content useful, valuable, helpful, and always on the lookout to read from you
again.


What Can You Do To Create Content That Cuts Through The
Noise
There’s a lot of similar content out there ranking for the same keyword. So, what
exactly can you do to cut through the noise and stand out as a SaaS startup.
Simple, create opinionated content.

In most cases, opinionated content is written by an expert, adds value to the
industry, and brings about interesting discussions.

The downside of opinionated content is that the traffic doesn’t compound. There’s
little to no search related to it on Google. And in most cases, people tend to forget
about your opinion after some months or years.

That said, it’s a great way to:

- Establish yourself as an authority in your industry.

- Grow an audience for your SaaS startup.

- Increase user signups and customers.

- Earn links naturally without begging for them.

They found out that most of its users are startup owners who needed practical
advice on solving the day-to-day problems they’re facing in their business. So,
they started sharing how they were building their business and what they were
learning along the way. And before long, they saw results.




Take this post where they shared their struggles getting on Hacker News front

With comments like these from readers, it shows that they’re adding value to them.
And, when most of these readers need a customer support SaaS solution, Groove
will be one of their top choices.

Another excellent example of opinionated content from Groove is this post about
the 26 blogs that helped them in their journey to $100K/month.

Most startup owners who are Groove’s target audience want to know the blogs
they can read to grow their business. So while most articles rehash blogs they
never visited, the Groove team wrote from their personal experience.

And when you search Google for the keyword “startup blogs,” this piece of content
they wrote over six years ago still ranks number 1.

When Should SaaS Business Owners Write Opinionated Content
for Their Brand and Why?
[Expert insight from Ryan Law, Director of Marketing, Animalz]

“I recommend opinionated content in three common situations:

One, when you need to differentiate in a crowded marketplace. If every other blog
in your industry follows the same cookie-cutter content process, ditching the
SEO and “ultimate guides” and sharing contrarian opinions is a powerful way to
demonstrate personality and share something memorable.

Two, when credibility is a bigger problem than awareness. Listicles and “what
is” content are great for generating traffic, but they’ll never convince senior
managers, executives, or marketing-allergic professionals (like developers) to
take you seriously. Instead, smart, well-founded opinions demonstrate an expert
understanding of your industry, allowing you to go beyond the dime-a-dozen “best
practices” and share opinions that only true professionals have.

Three, when you want to rally a community around you. Opinionated content
polarises, and that’s a great thing. Business sells to passionate brand advocates,
and not half-interested consumers. Opinions allow you to attract a small, loyal
audience of people that subscribe wholeheartedly to your ideas.”

Tactic 5: Leverage Insights From Subject Matter
Experts
This involves reaching out to experts and curating their insights to create high-
quality, in-depth pieces of content.

Say you run an email marketing software and want to write about “how to improve
email open rates.” Then, you can reach out to email marketing experts to contribute
their best tips on improving email open rates.

And guess what?

You’d have tons of tips regarding this topic to include in your content.

That’s not all…

These experts will most likely share your content on social media platforms and
link to you.

A win-win, right?

Not only are you able to create high-quality content at scale that’d add value to
your audience, but you can also leverage other experts’ audiences to promote
your content and reach more people.

Now, you may be wondering if it’s effortless to get experts to add their voices to
any piece of content you’re creating.

Here’s the thing…

Getting experts to feature in your article is much easier than you think.

First, you need to establish rapport and show them what is in it for them. If you
have a high domain authority, promising a link back to each contributor’s website
or article will likely make you have more contributors than you can handle.

Think this is a mere theory? Let me show you an example of a B2B SaaS company
that does this so well.

Tactic 6: Become The “Go-to” Expert In Your Niche
If you care about ranking for keywords that matter to your business, you should
establish topical authority fast, especially if you’re starting from scratch. This is an
often-neglected yet important ranking factor.

For instance, if your SaaS startup is about email marketing, ranking for keywords
related to your website’s general topic is much easier.

In contrast, if your SaaS startup is about LinkedIn lead generation and you’re
writing about conversational marketing, it’ll be difficult to rank for that keyword,
even if you have the best content on the web.

Truth is…

When you have topical authority for the niche you’re covering, you will find it
much easier to rank any piece of content you publish.

Let me share an example to show you how this works in real life.

That’s not all…

At the end of each chapter, there’s an easy navigation to all pages, plus an internal

As you can see, each chapter covers a different topic. However, they’re all interlinked
together. Hence, making it easy to pass link juice across all the chapters and rank
high for the main keyword.

Since all the chapters are related to SEO and cover each aspect in-depth, Google
sees it as the most authoritative article on the topic and continues to rank it high
on the SERPs. This SEO moat by Moz is known as creating a topic cluster.

And the result from this piece alone is incredible.

According to SEMrush, this guide brings in over 177,000 organic traffic visitors
per month, which costs around $1.3 million.

Tactic 7: Drive High-quality Conversions From
Ungated Templates
Conversions matter more than anything for a SaaS startup. Without conversions
(such as user signups, leads, and customers), you’ll most likely find it difficult to
justify your investment in content marketing.

So, how exactly do you drive conversions from your content pieces as a SaaS
startup?


Enter Conversion-focused Content Marketing
Conversion-focused content marketing helps you drive conversions for your
startup.

This is important because the more conversions you achieve, the more users you
can get to sign up for your software. And in the long run, the more revenue you
can generate for your business.

Here is an excellent example of a company that excels with this strategy.


How Smartsheet Intelligently Drives Conversions With
Downloadable Templates Without Gating Them
If you’re in the project management space, you’ll probably have heard about
Smartsheet. If you don’t know about them, it is a SaaS product that helps users
assign tasks, track projects, manage calendars, and share documents using a
tabular user interface.

Smartsheet wants business owners who use Excel to use their products instead.
So, they’re a big Excel competitor.

To dominate the industry with many competitors, they focus on creating template
pages. This means that they compile templates that’d be useful for their readers

- Tactic 7: Drive High-quality Conversions From Ungated Templates                 Your Content Mart
Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/


and write an article related to them and offer those downloadable templates for
free.

If you check the Smartsheet blog, you’re likely to come across posts such as these:




On the surface, it might look like offering free templates that can be easily
downloaded is not a good idea.

But when I dug deeper, I found out that they’re using these templates to increase

Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/


user signups for their business.

Take this template page about SWOT analysis as an example.

Anyone searching for such a keyword on Google is most likely a business owner
looking to analyze the opportunities in their market and how they can compete,
which is a segment of their target audience.

Also, anyone who stumbles on this page is looking to download SWOT analysis
templates which they can use right now. However, they might not know exactly
how Smartsheet fits into that, and this is where it gets exciting.

First, on the page’s header and immediately beneath the title, there’s a call to
action asking the reader to try Smartsheet for free.




Second, a static CTA is visible while you’re scrolling down the page, urging you to
try Smartsheet for free.




- Tactic 7: Drive High-quality Conversions From Ungated Templates               Your Content Mart
Join SaaS Growth Bites Newsletter —>>>> https://yourcontentmart.co/saas-growth-bites/


Each template on the page follows the same pattern of title, screenshot, download
button(s), and short description.

You can either download the template on Smartsheet and Excel or excel only.
Here’s what that looks like:




The Excel option makes it easy for anyone to download the templates without
signing up for a free trial or entering their contact information.

When you click on the option to download via Excel, a pop-up that looks like this
shows up:

Again, they want you to become a user while still on the page. There is an option to
decline and continue your download immediately without asking for your contact
information.

If you click on the Smartsheet option, you’ll be redirected to a page that looks like
this.

As you can see, Smartsheet only asks for your contact information when you’ve
shown interest in trying out their tool. Thoughtful approach if you ask me.

Another interesting aspect of this Smartsheet template page strategy is that they
designed the Excel sheet templates to drive conversions.




In Excel, they’re promoting their software and prompting anyone who’s downloaded
the template to try out their tool for free for 30 days.

And guess what?

This strategy works for Smartsheet.

According to Ahrefs, about 2,260 organic pages on Smartsheet’s website have
the keyword “templates” in their URL.

While we can’t estimate the exact number of conversions they’re getting from
these pages, they’re killing it organic-traffic-wise from this strategy.

They’re ranking for over 48,593 keywords, which bring in about 430,000 organic
traffic visitors every month, as per Ahrefs estimates.

Using conversion-focused content assets such as this, you won’t struggle to
increase user signups for your SaaS startup.


What Can SaaS Startups Do to Generate More Conversions From
Content?
[Expert insight from JH Scherck, Founder, Growth Plays]

“If you are trying to generate leads for your sales team, implement live chat. This is
because increasing conversions comes down to reducing friction. One of the best
ways a B2B company can reduce friction and lower the barrier to entry is to add live
chat to their site with prompts that are contextual to the page.

Additionally, they need SDRs that can quickly and knowledgeably answer visitor
questions about the product in real-time.”

FOREWORD

It's April 2018. I'm in the office with my team in Eindhoven.
I know, you’ve probably never heard of that place before,
but that's just because it's somewhere in the south of this
tiny country called The Netherlands. It's a little bit boring
and it almost always rains, so don’t bother rushing here for a
vacation.
The office where I am, on the other hand, is not boring at
all. On the contrary: exciting things are happening here.
After running my first startup for the last 8 years and scaling
it into a seven-figure business, I was on to something new.
The inspiration for my newest idea came from “scratching
my own itch”, so to speak. Based on our user growth and
their feedback, it became clear that we needed a way to
manage user feedback in a more efficient way. And so we
started building this new business from scratch.
I’ve learned so much from scaling my other business that I
had the confidence to make this new startup equally
successful. Fast forward: we grew from $0 to over $1,000
MRR in just a couple of months.
In this ebook, I want to share my real-life lessons for starting,
validating and scaling your SaaS.

INTRODUCTION

So, you’re building or scaling a SaaS? Great choice! I think
subscription-based companies are the future of our
economy. Why? We see it all around us: TV is losing market
shares to subscription-based companies like Netflix; physical
product companies like Gilette, who dominated the market
for years, are losing shares to subscriptions players like
Dollar Shave Club; and even advertising-based enterprises
like newspapers are shifting to a monthly subscription
model. Why are they doing this?
There are 2 important shifts in the market happening right
now.
Consumers: “We want the milk, not the cow”
Consumers want everything to be accessible, but they don’t
have the money to buy it all at once. By paying a low
monthly fee for just using the product instead of owning it,
everything is accessible at a low cost. Why own a car if you
can just rent it when you need one?

Companies: “The end of budgeting”
For companies, this is great too. Remember those days
where you would need to come up with a plan for next year
based on an estimated budget? Those days are gone. With
SaaS, there’s a lot of data in play. You can now instantly see
if your subscription revenue is growing and make a fair
estimate of your income in the next couple of months.
Netflix knows it can spend another $50 billion on new series
and films because of its subscription-growth. The money is
already in the bank.
As you can see, SaaS can be a very lucrative business with a
lot of possibilities. But:
•

How do you start your own SaaS?

•

How do you validate it?

•

How do you make it profitable?

•

How do you scale it?

In this book, we’re going to talk about all of that.
And, of course, as with everything, it all starts with the idea.

THE IDEA

As with every business, it all starts with an idea. But what is
so great about having an idea for a SaaS instead of having
an idea for, let’s say a new coffee brand, is that you can start
right away with validating the idea and getting people on
board. I mean like literally today.
When I came up with the idea of my SaaS, I literally started
the same day. Within a week I had an up and running
website and within a couple of weeks I had my first potential
clients. The best thing was that it didn’t take any secret
Getafix magic potion. I did it all on my own, and so can you.
Crafting an idea for your SaaS: Framework
I’ve had more than 8 businesses in total. Not all of them
succeeded, but because of my startup experience, I now
know a thing or two about creating a SaaS business idea. If
you have no clue about what kind of SaaS you would like to
start, I suggest reading more of this paragraph. If you’re
already on to something, go ahead, and skip it.
There are a couple of ways to come up with a potentially
valid idea for your SaaS. The most important ratio, to me, is

this one: PROBLEM < > SOLUTION. Let’s look at some
examples:

It’s fairly simple but highly effective to start writing down
problems and (possible) solutions.
What problem are you solving? And how are you going to
solve it?
How to come up with potential problems to solve?
Well, I dare you to look into these potential idea ponds:

•

Scratching your own itch

Do you see anything around you that could be improved?
Whether it’s making something easier, more fun or cheaper,
if you can identify a struggle in your own life, write it down.
This could come to you at home, in your car, at work, or
heck, even when you’re in the shower. Sometimes the next
big thing is something really small, just like Johan Vaaler
discovered when he invented the paperclip in 1899. Let that
be your inspiration.
•

Outdated markets

Just like Uber came up with a new innovation in the taxi
market, and Airbnb reimagined the hotel market, many
markets are still slow to evolve – if they even change at all.
Do some research and try to figure out which market has
potential. Who knows, maybe your product is going to be
the next disruptor of it.
•

Talk to friends and family

Just like you face problems, struggles or irritations, so do
your family and friends. Talk to them! Write down their
thoughts on things that could be improved.

•

Research the internet

Because we’re talking about SaaS here, the internet is a
really good place to look for ideas. Go on Twitter, Quora or
Reddit and look for people who are irritated about
something. “I can’t find a decent app for X” or “I’m
struggling with my workflow” or “I need help with so and
so”. You name it. There could be a potential product in
every need out there.
Of course, there are many potential factors to kill your idea.
For example, does anyone else feel like your solution is a
real fix for a real problem?
In order to research this, let’s take a look at your target
audience.

Book recommendation: Traction can help
you speed up the process in just 5 days.

TARGET AUDIENCE

Now that you came up with an idea for your SaaS, it’s time
to decide who to build for. The key thing is to narrow down
your target audience as much as possible. I know, we all
want to become Jeff Bezos and sell to as many people
possible, but to become Jeff Bezos, we need to start like
Jeff Bezos.
In 1994, Jeff was working from his garage on Amazon. What
is now one of the biggest companies ever started very, very
small, with a narrow focus on a particular audience – bookbuyers. All of its website copy, marketing and other
advertising was dedicated to attracting people who wanted
to buy books. If a conglomerate as large as Amazon can
start out with a focused audience, then you can, too.
Narrow down your audience
Every new idea needs to be validated before you can call it
a real company. You’re about to invest a lot of your time,
energy and (probably) money, so it had better be good,
right? By narrowing down your target audience, you’re more

likely to succeed. Just like Amazon started by selling books
and later expanded to more markets, or like Uber started by
offering taxi rides in San Francisco and later expanded to
other cities (and now even expanding its services with
UberEats!), it’s really important that you start small to test
things out a bit.
There’s only one goal once you decide to build your SaaS:
validating the idea. And to validate it, you need (beta)
testers. And to attract testers, you need something
interesting for them to test. So, when you start your SaaS,
think about the needs of your audience and build
something specifically for them.
Let’s say you are building a project management app as
your SaaS. There are many tools out there already, but when
you create it for a specific audience – accountants, daycare
operators, web designers – it’s more likely to give you a
head start because you’re creating this tool specifically for
them. From that moment, you’re not just making “a project
management tool”; you’re creating “THE project
management tool for X”.
This is exactly what we did with our SaaS Upvoty. As a user
feedback tool, our SaaS could have potentially been used
by many businesses in different markets. However, we
decided that we wanted to validate the idea for a specific

audience first, just as a means to test it out and optimize the
product based on user feedback, which is something we
care about a lot. (Duh! That’s why we created Upvoty in the
first place.)
What we learned is that you can’t narrow down your target
audience enough. Really. When you think you have the
perfect target audience, try narrowing it down some more,
and then a bit more after that. As we were brainstorming
about our perfect target audience, we thought we had it
when we landed on ‘startups’. It seems logical because
startups have a new product and they’re just starting up, so
they need feedback, right? While that might be true, one of
the problems we soon noticed was that there’s no real
message to write to “startups”.

I mean, a startup could be anything really. So we need to
narrow it down some more.
Eventually, we came to ‘SaaS startups’ and we would focus
on businesses located in either English-speaking countries
or companies from The Netherlands, where we are based.
This made things so much easier! We could now potentially
talk directly to our customers: “Hey SaaS startups: do you
want to manage user feedback in the best possible way?”.
Now that we’ve decided who to target, it’s time to actually
build something and validate the idea itself.

VALIDATING

We need to offer our target audience something that will
help them understand our product and a way for them to let
us know if they’re interested. Given the fact that we haven’t
even started, it needs to be something that is either free or
is highly cost-efficient. This is what the startup world calls a
‘minimal viable product’, or more simply an MVP.
When Dropbox created the idea of an online file-sharing
service, it was highly progressive, but because it didn’t exist
yet, this new way of file-sharing would demand a lot from its
potential users. On top of this, the software was extremely
complex to build and would take many months and tons of
money. So, there was a lot of risk at stake. Are they going to
build a new product that takes a lot of time and money with
no guarantee that will succeed? Of course not.
To validate the idea, they needed something to show
potential users what their service looked like and the
problems it would solve. However, building an actual
working prototype of this online file-sharing service would
take months, and would also cost plenty of money. So, they

came up with a very smart way to validate the product: a
video.
They built a landing page with an explainer video
embedded on the top of it. People who visited the website
could learn more about the product by reading about this
new online file sharing principle and they could watch a
video that both informed them and made them excited.
On this page, there was
a little subscription box
below the video where
people could sign up if
they were interested in
using such a product.
They launched the website and went to bed. When they
woke up the next day, they couldn’t believe it. There were
already more than 75,000 sign-ups! I guess that’s when you
know your idea has potential, right?
Now, you don’t need 75,000 sign-ups like Dropbox. I mean,
we did nearly the same thing and only had 100 sign-ups
before we launched Upvoty, but you do really need some
kind of validation. Building a landing page with a sign-up
form embedded is really one of the quickest and cheapest
things you can do, and it works like a charm!

Other examples of MVPs:

advanced and automated voucher
system.

Zappos

Founder Nick Swinmurn took photos of
shoes he wanted to sell in local stores
and if customers ordered them, he then
physically purchased the product and
sold them.

Book recommendation: Lean Startup is the
holy grail if you want to learn more.

HOW TO BUDGET

Now that we’ve validated the idea and we’ve seen that
there’s potential, it’s time to spend all of our money on
building the complete product, running ads and hiring
influencers! Oh no, #badidea if you ask me.
The reality is that you only have X amount of money to work
with. We need to come up with a plan to use it wisely in the
most efficient and effective way. How can you make sure
that you win enough new customers before burning all your
cash? My answer: budget blocks!
Budget blocks
The way I work with my budget on the product
development of my SaaS is by dividing my tasks into smaller
steps. This is good for two very important reasons: the
budget and the customer’s happiness. Let me explain.
Product Development Stage 1
It looks a bit like this:

Let’s say you have 3 stages of Product Development (PDs)
and you have $10,000 to work with. The first thing you’ll
have to ask yourself is: “What’s absolutely needed to attract
the first few paying customers?”
When you invest your money, you want to get it back as
soon as possible. Burning money on things that will
eventually attract new paying customers is the best thing
you can do. It will be purely an investment this way.
In order to come up with things for Product Development
stage 1, you need to make a list. A list that contains things
that are crucial for you to build and market the product and,
ideally, a list of features that potential clients told you about.

Talking to potential customers can be a crucial and wise
thing to do here.

Now that you’ve created a list for PD1, you have to break
down the budget. How much does it cost to accomplish this
stage? Make sure it’s never the full budget, because,
despite the fact that you believe in this product (and yes, we
already validated its potential), there’s absolutely no
guarantee it will work out. As a matter of fact, it will almost
never immediately work out the way you want, so keep
some budget in your pocket for later.

Let’s say PD1 costs us $3,000 to get us started. We will build
a basic website, create social channels, payment integration
(to collect money from our users!) and the MVP (prototype)
of the SaaS product itself.
Next up: put it into practice! Go build and launch the darn
thing. Listen to the market: how are they responding to your
product? What are the first trial users saying? Collect as
much feedback as you can. Every opinion matters in this
stage. Learn from your users and their needs.
Product Development Stage 2

Now that we’ve collected user feedback and have a sense of
how our product is doing, it’s time to optimize. Good thing
we have some budget left, huh?
Before we go on, let’s prioritize the feedback first.
Paying customer feedback
Feedback from paying customers, or at least customers with
a high potential for becoming a paying client, is the
absolute best feedback you can get. It’s not because they’re
bringing money to the table. No, it’s because they are
spending actual money out of their own pockets. They
literally feel the pain of burning money themselves. They are
giving feedback because they want your product to improve
in order to work for them. Free users, on the other hand, are
most likely to ask for a lot because, well, it’s free. So like
almost any other consumer on Black Friday, they want
MORE, MORE, MORE! For free, of course.
Second. You need to stick to your product’s vision as much
as possible. If you notice a lot of users asking for something
that wasn’t initially part of your vision, you can ask yourself if
you need to change your vision a bit. However, if it’s any
other case, stick with your initial plans.
Last, but not least, how much will these new optimizations
cost? If a (potential) customer of $50 a month is asking for a

new feature that will cost you $5,000 to build, that would be
nuts!

Prioritize PD2 based on high demand from (potential)
paying customers, and make sure it aligns with your
product’s vision and fits your budget. This way, the next
stage of product development will be more cost-efficient
and have a bigger effective on customer satisfaction
because you’re building a better product based on the
feedback you’ve received.
Always ask for feedback

So, remember: at the end of each Product Development
block, ask for user feedback. This way you’re always on top
of user needs and you’re spending your budget wisely. WINWIN!

about budgeting in Intercom on Starting up.

PRODUCT-MARKET FIT

The idea behind launching and scaling in different stages
has everything to do with the search for product-market fit.
What is Product-Market Fit (PMF)?
It’s the journey a company takes to identify the right target
customer and serve them with the right product.
Simple, right?
When you launch your product, you think you have an idea
of who your target audience is and what product they need.
But as you will soon find out, it’s not that simple. Your idea
of how to use your product will most likely not align with
how your customers think it needs to work. And honestly,
that’s fine! This is you learning from the feedback of your
customers. It will help you define your product, your
solution and what types of customers you need to serve. In
other words, moving towards Product-Market Fit.

How to find Product-Market Fit?
Feedback will be crucial here. Without talking to your
customers and measuring their real problems and needs,
you are most likely not getting a clear view of what market
your product serves best. And this is key. Why? Once you’ve
figured out who your ideal customers are, everything – and I
mean everything – becomes so much easier.
Let me give you an example of my own.
In Chapter 2, we talked about our target audience. When
we narrowed it down, we decided to focus on SaaS startups.
When we got the first few clients we did a few things to get
to know them better:
•

We sent personal emails asking about them and their
businesses.

•

When we had them on chat, we took time to get to
know them personally.

•

Every once in a while we asked how they were doing
with our product.

•

We tracked user comments on our feedback boards
(using Upvoty of course!)

•

Measured the churn rate and upgrades.

Soon, we had a pretty good picture of what our existing
user base looked like and which customers were most
valuable to us. It turned out that most of our users were
either founders of small SaaS startups or product managers
from SaaS companies. As we learned more about our ideal
customer, we found our Product-Market Fit and started to
zoom in a bit more on this specific audience, which made
our work a whole lot easier.
•

Writing content: We did some research on what
SaaS founders and Product Managers find most
interesting and started blogging about it.

•

Website copy: We started to adjust our message
more and more towards SaaS-minded products.

•

Acquisition: We don’t do a lot of acquisitions, but if
we see a SaaS founder or Product Manager and
there’s a chance to speak to them, we will. This
almost always turns into a highly interesting prospect.

•

Link building: We started to look for websites where
our target audience is highly active and started to
contribute to the blogs. This did 2 things: we got in
front of our audience and it increased our authority in
the space where we wanted to be seen.

•

Product features: We started to focus more and
more on features that contribute to SaaS products
and SaaS Teams.

Finding your Product-Market Fit will help make your
marketing and day-to-day business operations so much
more efficient and effective.

Book recommendation: Lean Startup is
really helpful in finding PMF.

PRODUCT-CHANNEL FIT

Once you figure out Product-Market Fit, it’s time to figure
out what Andrew Chen and Brian Balfour call “ProductChannel Fit”. This basically means identifying your perfect
marketing channels, particularly the one or two that can take
you from wherever you are to the next level.
The whole process of “growth hacking” isn’t about, “Can I
get social media to work? Can I get ads to work? Can I do
SEO? Can I do content marketing?” In other words, trying to
grow your marketing on every given channel out there. No,
it’s the exact opposite. You have to invest in just one or two
and grow them into successful channels first.
This has everything to do with budget and capability. As a
startup with limited resources, it’s hard to achieve success at
three (or more) channels at the same time. For one, you
probably don’t have enough budget to spend on all, and
second, your team isn’t capable of handling all of this. You
also still have to build the product, provide customer
support, etc.

Growth Hacking framework
If you really want to be effective and efficient with your
budget vs. outcome, it’s all about finding the one or two
channels that work for you. And remember to get one
humming along before going after the next one.
But how do you decide which channels to focus on?
Well, now that you’ve reached Chapter 6, you probably
already figured out who your ideal target audience is, right?
If not, you really have to go back and figure this out first. It’s
going to be crucial to this framework.
Where is your target audience?
This is the first question we need to answer. Where are your
ideal customers actively present? Are they on social media?
If so, which channels? Are they active on Twitter, Facebook
and Instagram, or more likely to be on Snapchat?

The above framework can help give you an idea of how to
think. Imagine your ideal customer and all of the channels
out there. Write them all down and research them one by
one to figure out if they really are present. You can give
scores to the channels to indicate if there’s a lot of potential:

Once you’ve figured out where your target audience is
active, you need one or two channels that can get you quick
results. Why? If you can get quick results on how your target
audience reacts to your efforts, you can decide much faster
whether or not to proceed.
Effort-Outcome
If your audience is on Instagram, you can choose to set up
an Instagram account, create a strategy and content, and
then wait for things to happen. But, the ratio effort-outcome
is very low on this one. It would be better to start

advertising on Instagram instead, for example. This way you
can easily check how effectively you can reach your
audience on this medium. If your ads are getting hits and
engagement, it’s then time to decide whether or not you
want to invest in a proper Instagram page and strategy.
Otherwise, move on to the next channel.
How to target your target audience?
Creating ads and content all depends on where you want to
reach your audience. If your audience is active on TikTok,
you need to start making specific videos for that. If they’re
on LinkedIn, you need to invest in writing articles, etc.
Besides creating content specifically for targeting your
audience, you may want to invest in creating content that
could benefit your brand, too.

The ideal marketing situation would be one where you have
effective strategies to target your audience one-on-one
mixed with a few that indirectly target them as well. For
example, when you know your target audience, you can
easily create content that will reach them one way or
another:
•

Blog posts: Write about topics they care about.

•

Podcast: Host a podcast on topics they’re interested
in, or participate on a show they’re listening to.

•

Guest blogging: Create an article for a website
where your audience is a reader.

•

E-book: Write and publish an ebook that could
potentially land in the hands of your ideal customers
(like this one, for example ;)

Whatever you do, take it slowly, step-by-step. Start with one
channel and get it to work for you. Only then do you go on
to the next one until you’ve built a portfolio of highly
effective marketing channels.
Book recommendation: Traction will help
you choose the right channels.

OPTIMIZE & ITERATE

Your product is never finished and the feedback from your
users will never end. And that’s totally fine, as long as you
continuously work step-by-step towards a better version of
your product. You launch, get feedback, optimize and
iterate. The BML framework can help you with that.
Build-Measure-Learn
BML stands for Build, Measure & Learn.

You build your product, launch it and start measuring the
results. How are users interacting? Which features do they
use and which do they ignore? What feedback and new
feature requests are you getting from our users? When you
ship things (i.e. put a product out), you can start to measure
and learn immediately. Once you’ve done that, you can start
building the next version of your product, and then start all
over again with measuring and learning.
Ship fast!
If you have a new feature, ship it as soon as possible! This
way you’ll instantly know how your users feel about it. The
thing is, you can’t know ahead of time how users will think
about the new feature or how (and if) they are going to use
it. As a result of fast shipping, you can start building a better
version of it while spending time on actual user feedback.
It’s like baking a wedding cake
I love the parable by Des Traynor, who compares this
process with baking a wedding cake.

“Start off with a cupcake. You’ll learn the flavors you like,
uncover any problems in your kitchen, and in general, you’ll
fast-forward the feedback loop. You can then step up to a
regular size cake, safe in the knowledge your ingredients are
all fresh, your oven works, and your flavors are nice. Only
then can you deliver a wedding cake.”
I love this way of looking at product iteration. I mean: you
can come up with the “flavors” and build them into an
actual feature. But wouldn’t you rather just let everyone try
the flavors first?

RECURRING ACQUISITION

As a SaaS, you’re in the recurring revenue space. Every
month you hope to serve the same clients again and again
by building a great product and providing outstanding
customer support. But what if you have a recurring
acquisition model, too? A mechanism for free acquisition,
every month. That would be great, right?
Well, this is closer than you might think.
Word-of-mouth
If you build something awesome and provide a way to share
it, your users will definitely talk about it with their friends
and families. Think about Uber. Customers of the app tend
to share their rides on social media, because, well, they
think it’s cool. Or like Slack: Once you’re a user, you can’t
live without it. Every user has the opportunity to acquire one
of their co-workers.

Affiliate program
Many software companies provide links which the user can
share and once someone from their network signs up, they
will get a discount on their monthly subscription. Very smart
and very low acquisition costs for acquiring a new customer.
Build-in links and referrals
When people use your software, make sure users of their
users see which software it is. A practical example is our own
software. We’ve built-in a smart link to our website on the
feedback boards. It’s proven to be a cash cow.

Each time our users share their feedback boards with their
users, we get in front of potential new customers.
The best and most recognizable example may be Intercom.
How many people have already seen that iconic chat
balloon on the bottom right corner of thousands of

websites? And when it pops open, it’s right there: Intercom’s
cash cow.

Ebooks, podcasts and evergreen content
Imagine this: you’ve published an ebook that will be
downloaded and shared by many people. It will rank in
search engines for a long time and is mentioned on popular
blogs. What do you think this can do for your recurring
acquisition? The same goes for your interviews on podcast
shows, creating YouTube content or writing outstanding
evergreen content on your blog.

THE ‘AHA’ MOMENT

Oprah, come in!

In all seriousness: the ‘Aha’ moment is your true power.
When your users find their eureka, you’re set and done. The
sooner, the better.

The real value gets it done
Your company will stay in the danger zone until your users
experience the full value of your product. They’re spending
real money on a product that needs to deliver real value for
them. And, of course, you think you’re already providing
value right from the start. Wrong! Although most users will
have a clue about what your product can do, and they are
most likely willing to give it a try, you have to make sure they
will actually experience the value. In other words: finding
the Oprah moment: Aha!
The key
To get your users to this eureka moment as soon as
possible, the first thing you want to know is what they really
need and which features are contributing the most in finding
the eureka moments. The tricky thing here is that almost
every business has different and unique needs, so you
almost never work within a static framework. Instead, try to
measure what actions a user takes and which next steps you
can recommend. For example, when a new user signs up
and you ask him or her for their job description and
company size, you can immediately identify if they have a
(big) team. If so, let them invite coworkers. The more people
that get on board, the more likely it is that your product will
be adopted within the company.

Find the frictions
You can come up with an onboarding framework all you
want, but if the path is not clear, your users will never find
their ‘Aha’ moment. Always measure the following:
•

What emails are effective?

•

What links do they click?

•

Which buttons are they ignoring?

•

What support questions do you get?

•

Which things are not clear?

•

What steps are they missing?

Learn from these metrics and feedback and try to solve the
problems. Make it easier for the user. Make the path more
clear by, for example, adding more items to your FAQ,
building an onboarding checklist widget that contains the
first 5 steps to take, improving your email copy, and so on.

Reduce churn
You don’t want to lose customers. When a user finds the
‘Aha’ moment, they’re less likely to churn. Think about what
the magic moment is for your product and make sure
people will experience it as soon as possible.

Book recommendation: Hooked helps your
users stick with your product.

MEASURE THE RIGHT METRICS

One thing I see going wrong with a lot of SaaS companies is
they measure the wrong data. Don’t get me wrong,
measuring new sign-ups and how many visitors you’ve had
last month do matter. But to get serious about optimizing,
you need to measure different data at each stage of your
company.
Churn
Churn is most SaaS company’s nightmare and is often seen
as the most important measurement of their product.
Although churn can be seen as a factor of declining monthly
growth, on the other hand, the impact on customer lifetime
value is equally significant. If your customers aren’t sticking
around for many years, and they are already gone within a
couple of months, you have a leaky bucket. Don’t look at
churn from month to month and keep the lifetime value in
mind. If the statistics show that most of your customers
aren’t a client for long, you have a problem. Most of the
time it’s happening because of a bad business model. Ask

yourself this: is there a reason why my customers would use
our software two years from now?
The early days
When you’re just starting out, you have to look at a whole
other set of metrics. But, as we just learned, keep in mind
that you will reach a point where churn matters, and that a
good business model is key to growing and scaling your
customer retention.
Measuring churn right from the start can help you notice
how you’re doing. When you only have 100 users and lose
5% of your customers each month, that’s not hard at all,
right? Wrong! I mean, losing 5 customers won’t count right
now, but imagine having 1,000 users with the same
percentage of churn. That means you’ll lose 50 customers
each month.
Every company experiences customer churn and you
probably can’t bring your churn to zero. Or can you? In fact
you can, with pricing!

Book recommendation: Hooked helps your
users stick with your product.

PRICING

Let’s dive into different pricing models:
Put a price on it!
The first thing I would consider crucial is asking for real
money in exchange for your product. I know, it’s hard to ask
for money, but come on...you’ve worked hard to make a
product that provides a real solution. Although it might not
be perfect, if it provides value, your customers should pay
for it.
If you don’t know what to charge, you can do two things:
•

Look up the prices of your competitors and see if you
can price a bit lower.

•

If you don’t have any competitors, just put a price on
it and see what happens! If you gain a lot of
customers, you can easily increase the price.

Whatever you do, make sure you price your product
because you’re going to need money in order to improve it.

Freemium
We don’t have a freemium model, but that doesn’t mean I
don’t believe in it. I think it works really well for some
businesses.
Take Dropbox for example. They give away free limited
space, but as soon as you hit that limit, you need to
upgrade to a paid plan. By the time you hit the limit, all of
your files, comments and shared documents are in your
Dropbox, and you’re most likely not going to cancel and
lose everything you’ve worked on. If you can get users
hooked on your service with limitations, freemium will work
for you.
We did a free beta period for three months and it actually
worked like a charm! But until your product is out there in
the wild, it's just an idea. You need feedback from real users
as soon as possible. There's really no better way to gain the
first few users than by giving it away for free. "Free" is
actually the wrong word in my opinion. You will get so much
more value in return: real customer feedback. This will
prepare you for a better launch and help you optimize the
product. I highly recommend it!
Variable pricing plans

You can charge a fixed monthly fee for your product, but
another way to grow your revenue per customer is to add
additional variable pricing plans. Using a pricing model that
has variables in it, such as a limited number of team
members, data export, tasks and more, can help you get
more revenue each month when your customers are
growing. It’s one of the things you can do to organically
grow your monthly subscription revenue without paying
more for your acquisition costs. It’s also a good way to
replace lost revenue by churned clients. If you can upsell
more revenue by existing clients, losing another isn’t as hard
as it would be.
Pricing needs to evolve constantly
The challenge with pricing is that it’s never a constant. Your
market evolves, the world evolves, your customers evolve,
your competition evolves, your product evolves and the
buyer’s needs change. And so must your pricing plans.
In order to keep up with all these changes, you need to
measure the data of both your existing customers and new
ones.
•

Which plan do people sign up for the most?

•

Which features are most popular?

•

What features contribute to the ‘Aha’ moment?

•

What new feature requests are you receiving from
both new and potential clients?

The ideal pricing model is to make sure there’s value in
every plan. Remember: you need to direct our users towards
that ‘Aha’ moment as soon as possible. If you hide critical
features that contribute to finding it, you can price as low as
you want, but your users will not stay with you for long and
certainly won’t be willing to upgrade.

Book recommendation: Intercom on Starting
up's chapter on pricing is epically brilliant!

LISTEN TO CUSTOMERS

Understanding the value of customer input is something I
learned the hard way. After running multiple businesses, I
learned that listening to your customers is a crucial factor in
product success. Remember, you’re not the customer, and
that’s a fact. I don’t care how much you look like the
customer, you have way too much knowledge about this
problem to assume that your way is the only way.
Do a lot of qualitative research and get something in front of
potential customers. Put a laptop in front of them and ask
them to sign and watch them do it. Ask them questions.
Track their behavior over time. Ask them what they like, and
just as importantly, what they don’t.
You can’t learn if you’re not putting your product in front of
users and track how they use it. The real key here is to talk
with them. It’s not important what they want but why they
want it. Only then can you really dive into the problem and
understand customer needs. Listen to your customers and
you will build a better product.

DON’T LISTEN TO CUSTOMERS

I know. I just told you why you should listen to your
customers. So, why this chapter? Hear me out.
The only time you shouldn’t listen to your customers is when
they’re asking for things that aren’t aligned with your
product vision. In that case, you have to stick to your guns.
Customer feedback should be there to inform you, not
make decisions on your behalf.
Saying ‘no’ is hard. Isn’t it?
Most companies won’t even get to the point of saying “no”
because they’re scared of disappointing users. While in fact,
it’s really the other way around. When you have open and
clear communication about your product vision, customers
are more likely to accept a “no” because, well, you are
giving them an honest answer. And believe us, that’s what
most companies fail to do. But the user never forgets.
Never.

It’s all about communicating
Just like in every relationship, communication is key.
Here’s where feedback tools like Upvoty can help you can
gather feedback from your users in a public space and let
other users upvote and discuss. Inform your users whether
or not it aligns with your product vision. Ask why they want
this certain feature, try to understand their needs and really
talk with your users. And who knows, maybe in the end the
user is right and you can change your product vision for the
greater good. The thing is: without really talking to your
users, you’ll never find out.
Do you see? It’s not only about listening to your users and
work for them. It’s about working together on building the
best product out there and being open in your
communication.

THINK LONG-TERM

I don’t believe in 5-year business plans and long-term
thinking. I always believed in just going out there and
seeing what happens. And that’s still true for the start, but
the funny thing about SaaS is that you CAN actually think
long-term. Your company is based on subscription growth
and data, and because of that, it can predict where you’re
heading.
Take Netflix for example. They’re spending $15 billion a
year on new series and films, and almost all of its new
content is a hit. That’s because they have gold in their hands
– upfront subscription revenue and data. Based on user
data, they know exactly which genres work and which do
not. With upfront monthly subscriptions and a predictable
growth rate, they know exactly what they can spend on new
content that will only increase their lifetime customer value
and customer growth. It’s a big contrast with Hollywood
production companies that spend a lot of money – upfront –
on films that potentially could fail. For that reason, more and

more companies, like Disney, are turning to subscriptionbased business models.
Running a SaaS is all about long-term: your customers are
using your software, and once they’ve built their business or
their habits around your platform, you’re the owner of a
goldmine. You will have all the data you need to make
optimization plans and the money to actually do it. But, that
doesn’t happen overnight. You need to win every customer
for the long-term. Start today.

I have asked some friends to contribute to this ebook by
answering 1 simple question:
🏆 What's your #1 SaaS growth tactic?
Here’s what they told me.
Victoria Rudi - Founder GroovyZebra
“Start building your audience… TODAY. Don’t wait until
your product is ready. Have a LinkedIn or IG account to
share your process and build your network. Launch a blog,
podcast, or YouTube channel based on the solutions your
product is providing. Know your ICP, understand their
burning pains and produce valuable content based on fresh
insights and actionable solutions. Start serving people

through relevant content to build an audience and to attract
your first 10, 100, 1000 REAL fans for exponential growth.

Dennis Smink - Founder Ploi
“Take your time to grow yourself and your SaaS application,
forcing growth will drive you crazy and impatient”

Leo Bassam - Founder Plutio
“Building a community around your business can help you
reduce churn, onboard new customers and grow your
business.”

Corey Haines - Head of Growth at Baremetrics
“Talking to customers. I always find that there are two types
of companies: those who guess and those who do customer
research. Customer research is like a video game cheatcode
that gives super powers to be able to see, understand, and
empathize with customers so that you can think just like
them. It's been the key to many campaigns, product
improvements, pricing changes, and new channels.”

Joshua Tiernan - Founder No Code Founders
“Try to build an audience before you launch. Bring on beta
users and engage them to find what they like/dislike about
the product. This will not only help you determine market
fit, but will also likely create a few early brand ambassadors
who will be happy to shout about your product once it
launches”

David Abrams - Founder Demio
“Build slow, learn fast. There’s no rush in the building of
your CORE MVP. It’s the key piece of everything you will
build upon. Take your time, be patient, hire slowly, and learn
from your customers early. Keep that feedback loop open
early and you’ll eventually build that value-driven app that
users love.”

Sahil Lavingia - Founder Gumroad
“Start with doing lots of cold emailing to potential
customers.”

So, there you have it. This is how we scaled our SaaS in just
a couple of months from $0 to $1,200 MRR. We talked
about creating an idea, validating and launching it.

or some, 2020 was the year of quickly adapting their content
marketing strategy. For others, it was the year to finally
develop one.

“Content marketing became more essential during the pandemic.
Due to a decrease in revenue, we weren’t pursuing paid advertising.
With restrictions and wanting to ensure the health and safety of
our team and clients, we had few in-person meetings. Content
marketing helped us stay in front of people digitally.”

“The pandemic made us create a strategy. Getting attention got
way harder, and we had to adapt. We built an SEO strategy and a
content marketing strategy on that, as well as a new website, and Companies became more empathetic

“Before the pandemic, my company did not have a marketing
presence at all. I was brought in to revamp the look and feel of a tired,
industrial B2B company and introduce new strategies to assist in sales
development. We have now completed a rebrand and are looking at
expanding our marketing presence even further.”

“We had to be more thoughtful about the topics we were covering,
as well as the target audiences we were approaching. Our core
audience is healthcare professionals, so we had to cover topics they
cared about rather than talking about what WE thought they cared
about (and risk appearing tone-deaf).”

58% SAID THEIR CONTENT MARKETING STRATEGY IS

“We understood that digital does not exist without real life.
We are now working on more ‘daily and authentic content’ for
brand awareness and trust. Selling will be the last step, not
the first one.”

“We changed the way we write,” one respondent said. “More
empathy and less hard sell. We don’t want to kick people when
they’re down. If your only objective is to force someone down
your journey or path, you should find another job. Give more
and take less!”

Success was mostly attributed to value content provides
Nearly a third (29%) of respondents said their organizations were
extremely or very successful with content marketing in the last 12
months – a figure that’s in line with what we find every year with

“We began paying more attention to social media platforms as well as

As several respondents said, the pandemic made content marketers
rethink how much content they deliver. We heard from many who cut back
on quantity to focus on quality.
“When everything went to digital there was an onslaught of emails,
podcasts, and webcasts. We forced ourselves to be much more thoughtful
in what we were putting out there, and if it wasn’t highly relevant to what
was going on at that moment in time, we didn’t produce and distribute.

Algorithms have been named a top concern in our past research, but

CLOSING THOUGHTS

THE GIANT IS AWAKE!
By Robert Rose, Chief Strategy Advisor, CMI

A

s we mentioned in the beginning
of this report, the pandemic has
awakened a sleeping giant (content
marketing, that is). Our research points
to transformational shifts to make
content marketing an ever more important part of the
integrated marketing mix.

In today’s modern business, everyone creates content —
from the web team to the marketing automation/demandgen team to the content marketing team, sales, agencies,
executives, even frontline account representatives. It’s
probably easier to count who DOESN’T create contentdriven experiences for customers these days.

But we must realize that this explosive trend is actually the

50

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The pandemic prompted new strategies to capture
audience attention.
Half of all respondents said it had become increasingly difficult to capture
their audience’s attention in the last 12 months. Many marketers shifted to
digital marketing and online selling. In addition, many said they adopted a
more empathetic tone toward their audiences. See pages 6 and 9.

Small teams are still the norm.

Virtual events and webinars produced the best results.
Respondents said that among the content types they use, virtual
events/webinars/online courses produced the best results in the last
12 months (58%) — the most successful agreed (66%). Webinars also
came out on top as the type of video format that produced the best
results. See pages 26 and 27.

Most marketers successfully used content marketing
to create brand awareness, build credibility/trust,
and educate audiences.

Our annual research consistently finds that most organizations have
small (or one-person) marketing/content marketing teams serving
the entire organization (58%). Indeed, many content marketers are
Creating brand awareness (80%), building credibility/trust (75%), and

Outsourcing budgets appear to have freed up a bit –
goals. See pages 37 and 38.

the biggest outsourcing challenge was finding
partners with topical expertise.

Among those who outsource at least one content marketing
activity, 40% said budget issues were a challenge compared with
51% the previous year, indicating more budget for outsourcing. The
top challenge for those who outsource was finding partners with
adequate topical expertise (65%) — a compelling reason to hire
employees who can learn the company’s products and market and/or
to hold on tightly to quality freelancers. See pages 18 and 19.

Marketers spent more on paid content promotion.
Forty-five percent of respondents said their spending on paid
channels increased in the last 12 months. Of those who used paid
content promotion, 77% used social media advertising/promoted
posts. The top two platforms where they’re spending? LinkedIn (75%)
and Facebook (69%). See pages 31 and 32.

51

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Content marketing budgets grew — and are expected
to continue to grow.
Forty-three percent of respondents who are familiar with their
company’s content marketing budget said their 2021 budget
increased over 2020. Furthermore, 66% expected their 2022 content
marketing budget to increase over their 2021 budget. See page 42.

Investment in events is expected to increase in 2022.
Fifty-two percent said they expected to increase investment in inperson events, 39% in hybrid events, and 33% in digital events. See
page 43.

Creating content that appeals to multi-level roles
replaced internal communication as the top content
marketing challenge.
While communication is still a challenge (38%), creating content that
appeals to multi-level roles within the target audience (44%) and
accessing subject matter experts to create content (42%) are now the
top two challenges. Why? It could be because more marketers are
using content collaboration tools (73%). In addition, there have been
numerous job changes over the last 18 months. See pages 14, 24, and 46.

Changes to SEO/search algorithms and data
management/analytics are top-of-mind issues
in 2021/2022.
Concerns about algorithms (62%) are nothing new — they’ve been a
top area of importance in our past annual studies as well. This year,
data management/analytics (50%) came in as the second top area.
This makes sense in a digital sales environment and as data becomes
more important to organizations in general. See page 47.

In addition to spending more on events, marketers
expect more investment in videos, owned-media
assets, and paid media in 2022.
We asked respondents which areas of content marketing they expect
their organizations to invest in during 2022. The top four answers
were videos (69%), events (61%), owned-media assets (57%), and paid
media (55%). See page 48.

METHODOLOGY & DEMOGRAPHICS
The 12th Annual B2B Content Marketing Benchmarks, Budgets, and Trends: Insights 2022 report was produced by Content Marketing Institute (CMI) and MarketingProfs and sponsored by ON24.
The online survey, from which the results of this report were generated, was emailed to a sample of marketers using lists from CMI and MarketingProfs.
A total of 1,275 recipients from around the globe — representing a range of industries, functional areas, and company sizes — replied to the survey during July 2021.
This report presents the findings from the 810 respondents who indicated:
u Their organization is a for-profit company, primarily selling products/services to businesses (B2B) or businesses and consumers (B2B+B2C)
u They are a content marketer, involved with the content marketing function, and/or someone to whom content marketing reports.
Note: Use caution when comparing this report’s findings to past years, as our methodology changed slightly. For the last several years, one of our qualifying criteria was that the respondent’s
company had used content marketing for at least one year. This year, we enabled respondents whose companies have not been using content marketing for at least one year (9% of the B2B pool) to
complete the survey. We also broadened the respondent pool to include worldwide respondents rather than those from North America only.

It establishes you as a thought leader and boosts sales by attracting people interested in your services.This ten-step guide will help you squeeze every last drop from your content and put your business in pole position.You will learn how to design a powerful SaaS content strategy and develop content ideas that resonate with your audience.Download our niche content marketing workbook to follow along.What Is Different about SaaS Content Marketing?SaaS content marketing strategy can often be complex because:SaaS services require a certain level of commitment, so establishing reputation and trust is essentialB2B transactions often involve more decision-makers and influencers, and often have longer sales cyclesDigital platforms involve technology, which can be difficult to understand initially—especially when the SaaS is truly innovative or unprecedentedFor all these reasons and more, you need to think of your SaaS content marketing strategy in terms of a marathon, not a sprint.Why is content marketing important for SaaS companies?Every company needs content marketing to grow organically—and this also holds true for brands offering SaaS products.The SaaS and tech sectors are unique in their nature. Their audiences are constantly looking to educate themselves and grow professionally.In fact, for some, content created by SaaS companies serves as their main source of knowledge and information.Producing content that helps your customers upgrade their skills is, therefore, key to building a loyal community, establishing your brand as athought leader, and building a sustainable revenue stream.Let’s take a look at a real-life example.Kinsta, a premium WordPress hosting provider, achieved a dramatic increase in website visitors by creating valuable, educational content. As of June 2022, they attract over 672,000 monthly organic views.Kinsta talks about topics that are not directly linked to the company’s hosting services. Instead, it focuses on its customers’ pain points and challenges.Their blog covers broad themes relevant to WordPress developers and website owners, thereby building awareness and trust among these audiences.How SaaS Content Marketing PerformsIn ourState of Content Marketing global report, we asked IT and SaaS companies how their content strategy was playing out. Here are some of the key takeaways.65% of SaaS companies have a fairly developed or advanced content marketing strategy92% of SaaS companies are finding some degree of success in their content marketing effort75% of SaaS companies expect to increase their content marketing budgets in 2022How to Create a Powerful SaaS Content Marketing StrategyNow, let’s explore the 10 steps you need to take to create a successful, high-performing SaaS content strategy.1. Start with Building a Foundation for Your Content StrategySome companies underestimate the importance of other marketing elements and get frustrated when content doesn’t bring the desired results. In reality, content works well when there’s a solid marketing strategy behind it.Before rushing into content creation, you need to make sure that you have all your processes, tools, and assets in place.So, what are the main items you should focus on?Get your product and brand story rightSaaS products are often less straightforward than other categories, requiring a deep understanding of the value proposition and messaging you want to deliver to your audience.Creating content without a solid business and product strategy will usually result in wasted resources and little-to-zero results.Vivek Shankar, Founder ofVivek Shankar Consultingsays:Many SaaS companies begin with SEO and then focus on the rest, getting it all backward. Your product and sales come first, so get that story in place before doing anything else.Vivek Shankar, B2B Fintech Content Writer and founder of Vivek Shankar ConsultingMake sure you have the following elements documented:Your overall targeting and segmentation strategyYour USP (unique selling proposition)—the core value offered by your companyYour overall messaging and positioning strategyYourbrand story—the narrative structure highlighting your background and your missionPrepare all necessary marketing assetsWriting blog posts before you have all website pages, forms, and workflows set up will also lead to a waste of resources. Make sure you have the following assets ready:An optimized website. Take care of such things as the website structure, keyword optimization, UX, page speed, and interlinking.A content marketing team. In-house or freelance, you need to have trained professionals who will take over the copywriting, design, and other areas of content production.Content marketing tools. Having a minimal tech stack at your disposal can dramatically increase your productivity and make your content strategy more data-driven. Start with setting up events in Google Analytics and using SEO tools for keyword and topic research.Define your content marketing goalsComing up with specific objectives will allow you to evaluate your progress and set realistic expectations.Consider setting up your goals at two main levels:The overall content marketing goals—e.g., the revenue or the number of Marketing qualified leads (MQLs) generated by content this year. Make sure to use multitouch attribution when evaluating your content's impact on the bottom line.Specificmetricsfor each content piece you produce—e.g., organic traffic for a blog post. Setting such intermediary KPIs is essential to better understand content performance when it comes to complex SaaS products.Based on our research, the top 3 content marketing goals for IT/SaaS companies are brand awareness, lead generation, and website traffic.Keep reading to learn more about building a powerful content funnel to reach your content goals.2. Go the Extra Mile When Researching Your AudienceAudience research is an essential part of building anycontent marketing strategy. It helps you understand your reader’s goals, challenges, questions, and doubts.However,customer analysisin the SaaS sector requires even more effort and resources, especially when it comes to B2B SaaS.Here’s why:The buying process in SaaS usually involves multiple steps and numerous people, from decision-makers to users and influencers.As such, you will need to understand who and when will interact with your content, and how to create an effective conversion workflow.For example, let’s imagine you work for an adtech company that has several personas engaging with its content: a decision-maker (CMO), a user (performance marketing specialist), and an influencer (CFO).In that case, you could come up with the following workflow:Create a free educational online course on performance marketing to attract users, build trust with them and showcase the solutionExpect some of the performance marketing specialists to share their credentials after completing the course and mention the tool to the CMOCreate a blog post about calculating marketing ROI and add a CTA (call-to-action) leading to a gated template to attract the CMOProduce sales enablement materials (e.g., a case study) and pricing pages to help the CMO convince the CFO that the purchase will create a positive financial impactAs you can see, there are multiple layers to take into consideration. But once you’ve figured it out, content marketing can turn into a revenue center for your company.Let’s look at a real-life example.ClickUpis a project management tool that targets diverse audience segments, from various teams (e.g., Marketing, DevOps, HR, and so on) to different types of companies (e.g., startups and enterprises).In this case, building differentiated approaches to content is essential. For example, when you land on ClickUp’s blog, you can choose content based on the type of work you do and the kind of challenges you have.How to Get a Deeper Understanding of Your AudienceThere are a few techniques you can use to get a deeper understanding of your audience. For example:Interview multiple types of customers, from users to decision-makers. Make sure to ask them questions about their behind-the-scenes process related to consuming content and making the purchase.Actively participate in online communities in your niche. This could be platforms likeGrowthMentorandGrowthHackers, Reddit threads, LinkedIn groups, etc.Collaborate with your Sales, Customer Success, and other customer-facing teams. Do your best to involve them in your overall content marketing processes.Build relationships with thought leaders and experts in your sector. This will help you get a better understanding of the landscape and access new audiences.3. Become an Expert in Your Field and Know Your Product Inside-OutExpertise is one of the foundations of creating successful, customer-focused content which builds audience trust.It’s therefore important to know your industry thoroughly.Many SaaS products are focused on difficult sectors, such as fintech,healthtech, or legaltech. Sometimes, it means that content marketers working in such companies have to learn a lot from scratch. And yet, it’s key to understanding your customers’ day-to-day goals and challenges.You can familiarize yourself with your industry in the following ways:Take part in customer research and sales processes. If you can, join and conduct interviews, participate in demo calls and analyze customer support requests.Subscribe to the newsletters of the biggest niche publications and check their daily or weekly digests. You can also listen to podcasts and watch YouTube shows in your chosen niche.Build relationships with your internal subject matter experts, learn from them, and involve them in content creation. These could be anyone from product managers and owners to the C-suite executives.Communicate with thought leaders and experts in your sector. These people are some of the most important sources of ideas and content for SaaS content marketers.Set upGoogle Alertsfor the core topics in your sector. For example, ‘digital advertising’, Google ads’ and ‘performance marketing’ for our adtech company.Keep track of the trending topics using theTopic Research tool.To find the recently trending topics in Topic Research, type in your main topic, wait for the tool to generate a list of subtopics, and select the 'trending topics first' tabNext, you need to make sure you and your content team are intimately familiar with your company’s product. SaaS solutions tend to be more complicated and thereby require constant training and monitoring of features updates.Deanna Berger, Senior Editor atEsper, recommends:Understand your software well enough to explain it to someone else succinctly and not in technical jargon. What is it used for, what problem does it solve, and how would an average person understand its core benefit?Deanna Berger, Senior Editor at EsperThis will also help you effectively create product-focused content and integrate your tools into the thought leadership content. At the same time, it allows you to align with other teams in your company, including product marketing, brand, and growth.Consider adding the following activities to your routine:Regularly explore your product: make sure you understand how the software works and what kind of features it hasJoin customer calls held by the product owners: It might help you gain insight into how people use your productFollow all product updates and new feature releases: make sure you understand what value they add4. Move Away from “Problem-Solution” Mentality and Think BigProblem-solution thinking refers to content that only centers on the issues your SaaS product solves.This is shortsighted because your readers and potential clients have lots of connected needs. By creating content with a broader appeal, you will increase your potential audience a hundredfold.Luke O'Neill, B2B FinTech writer, and owner ofGenuine Communications, says:SaaS wants to talk about the product, the product, the product. But your ideal buyers aren’t buying widgets, they’re chasing big scary goals like delivering internal and external projects, getting a promotion to a CXO role, being seen as an industry leader, or offering mentorship and guidance to others.Luke O'Neill, B2B FinTech writer, and owner of Genuine CommunicationsAn educational approach to SaaS content marketing can help your users beyond merely solving some of their functional work problems.For example, you can move them close closer to becoming industry leaders in their own right and prepare them for promotions.Focusing on empowering your readers, rather than pushing your own product, will ultimately help them remember you in the future.Let’s take a look at a SaaS brand that does this really well:How Flipsnack Guides Its Audience with ContentDigital publishing platformFlipsnackhas used its position to guide its clients on how they can ditch paper printing of brochures and pamphlets for more environmentally-friendly online options.Its blog content goes way beyond its solution though, including marketing, digital publishing, and business sections. Further, its content is highly practical, interactive, and engaging.As a result, it receives an enormous amount of average monthly views:As of June 2022, according to a Semrush analysis, it receives nearly 850,000 organic visitors a month, has generated more than 45 million backlinks and has an impressive authority score of 80.That being said, talking about your product is also perfectly fine when it organically fits the context. Remember, however, that your ultimate goal is to help users find the best solution to their problems.So, when deciding to mention your tool, make sure it truly adds value.You should also avoid positioning your product as the only solution to a problem. Instead, suggest it as one of the ways to tackle it and provide alternative routes.Masooma Memon, freelance SaaS writer says:While it’s okay to talk about your product, it’s not okay to position it as the only solution that your target audience has. That would be being dishonest to your audience. Which is why I recommend taking the following narrative arc for your product-led content: share 2-3 possible solutions to the problem, share their shortcomings, and finally position your tool as the best solution. The aim is to make a convincing case for your tool. Don’t forget, be clear about who you’re the best tool for (the specific audience that is).Masooma Memon, freelance SaaS writerFor example, this blog from Mentimeter,10 Best Survey Tools & Software in 2022, lists top survey tools, with its own SaaS product at the top of the list.5. Strengthen Your Thought Leadership and Get Creative with Content IdeasThere are numerous ways to position your company as a thought leader in SaaS, where brands often become a main source of education.For example, our hypothetical adtech company might be sharing performance marketing content on topics you’d never cover in universities.Therefore, your brand has all that it takes to play a crucial role in your customers’ lives, as long as you commit to delivering high-quality content driven by real-life experiences.HubSpot, for example, always promoted the concept of aligning your marketing strategy with the needs of your audience and focusing on inbound marketing.It was an innovative and resonating approach that turned into a major direction of modern marketing:Introducing such innovative concepts as the 'Flywheel' model helped HubSpot build its thought leadershipBy doing this, they managed to build a loyal global community going far beyond their product users.Thought leadership plays a crucial role in building brand awareness and creating communities for SaaS brands. To design an effective SaaS thought leadership strategy, focus on the following:Determine your key area and expertise and knowledge. For example, it could be about innovative ways to optimize ad performance for our adtech company.Stick to your brand story: the values and beliefs you want to promote. E.g., believing that there are ways to make digital advertising effective while respecting personal data privacyIdentify thought leaders and subject matter experts in your company. E.g., Product owners and performance marketing managers in the adtech company.Thought leadership content can exist in any format, and it’s never too early or too late to start building it.For example, you could launch a podcast—See theBreaking Brand podcast seriesfrom Buffer as an example—or access additional audiences by writing expert articles for industry publications.There are numerous ways to find inspiration for your thought leadership content:Use data from your product: Internal data could be used to point out usage trends, ad management strategies (in the case of our example), and more.Survey your users: Your customers, if they are willing to share, have a wealth of insights and data that lend themselves to thought leadership contentWork with the SMEs: Subject matter experts, whether in-house or external, can bring a new layer of insight to your content. Have a copywriter work with an SME for the best results.Collaborate with brands and influencers: Working with other players on the market can shift your perspective and bring a lot of interesting ideas to the tableCarry out research: Working with a market research agency can really lift your content with original data and facts. Your company can even position itself as an industry leader and go-to source for journalists and other experts.6. Build Authority by Diving Deeper into Content TopicsFor content to perform superlatively, you need to build what’s known as topical authority. In other words, content marketing does best when it dives deep into areas of expertise.So, rather than chasing after thousands of unrelated keywords (and creating shallow content), it’s better to find several core topics and diver further and further into them.It’s then a good idea to start your content planning process by examining those topics and then proceed to select the right sets of keywords.By doing so, you can get a better understanding of all the subtopics and questions that contribute to it. Besides, each topic would usually have a number of related and semantically related keywords.In the following example, we can see how an adtech company can generate numerous content ideas, based on one topic—Digital Advertising—by using theSemrush Topic Research tool.Here’s the workflow:First, type the phrase digital advertising into the topic research bar.In the example below, we have selected the Mind Map format to see a list of topics.Then we select the “advertising budget” topic.Now you can use the questions and headlines that come up in connection with the phrase “advertising budget” to help address the talking points for your next piece of content.Once you have your talking points and questions to address, we can take the phrase “advertising budget” and insert it into theKeyword Magic toolto find ideas for related keywords.By clicking on each returned keyword that is connected to “advertising budget” you can see how well the word performs in theKeyword Overview tool.Now you are in a position to use specific keywords and questions throughout your article addressing advertising budgets.Note that eventually, your piece can also end up ranking for a broader number of related keywords that form part of the topic.For example, if we google ‘advertising budget’ and check the page ranking first via theOrganic Research tool, we might find additional keyword ideas.You can also use theSEO Content Template toolto findsemantically related keywordsfor your piece.These are words that have a meaning that relates to your target keyword in some way. By including them in your content, they will help to add context and potentially further improve its performance in the search results.In the example below, we can see a number of semantically related keywords, such as ‘marketing budget’, ‘digital marketing’, ‘email marketing’, etc.7. Build an Effective Marketing Content FunnelAs we’ve covered, SaaS products are in a high-consideration group, especially in B2B scenarios. In other words, there are a lot of decision-makers to please, before winning a customer.That makes it key to create content that satisfies customer needs across all the touch points along the customer journey.You can do this by producing content for each funnel stage. A basic funnel takes the form of an inverted pyramid and has stages of Awareness, Interest, Consideration, and Conversion.Here’s a simple content marketing funnel and customer journey, along with some examples from SaaS and online service brands:AwarenessA potential customer is aware they have a problem to solve, but they are not sure what solutions are available.For example, a marketer needs to improve their in-house research capacity and they begin to look for solutions online.They search for how to conduct online market research and discover a range of help guides from different SaaS providers.In the example below we see guides from Momentive (Survey Monkey) and Hotjar, two companies that offer services in this niche.In the Momentive blog, we see how its own tool is put to use, through different topical survey reports:On Hotjar, we see content related more closely to customer questions and challenges. Here they share different types of customer feedback questions and product-related questions to ask.We also see a more bottom of the funnel (conversion level) content piece in the Introduction to Hotjar:InterestAfter reading through the content, a potential customer discovers there are a number of solutions on the market and they start to read about their options online.In this stage of the funnel, the potential customer starts following brands and asking questions.Going back to the digital publishing platform Flipsnack, the brand has created some top-quality interest/engagement-level content.In the example blog below, you can see how it uses its own tool to add interactivity and interest for the audience. This is a clever and non-salesy way to showcase its value proposition.How to start a digital magazineis full of advice and practical tips for marketers wanting to follow in Flipsnack’s footsteps. This brings potential clients back to explore more content and increases the chances they’ll sign up for the SaaS product itself.ConsiderationIn this stage of the content funnel, the potential customer knows what category of solution they need, but not which brand. They might watch webinars, download guides, read reviews, or sign up to your mailing list for more information.For example, Wistia’s amazingLow views, High impact series, is smart on many levels. As a video creation SaaS, it needs to overcome a big objection at the consideration stage: Viral videos are super hard to make.This series not only shares client success stories, humanizing the brand, but it goes to show that video content can be successful even when it doesn’t get millions of views.Lead magnets like case studies and ebooks might also fall into this funnel stage. These are content assets that sit behind an email gateway.Protip:Gated content has to be valuable. People don’t tend to give away their personal details unless they are very keen to learn something new. Be sure to deliver on what the content promises or you will lose trust, rather than gain it.See how Drift created a lead magnet with an overview of conversation automation technology providers—“New Tech: Conversation Automation Technology For B2B Marketing And Sales”.ConversionHere your customers are looking for details related to your deals, pricing, specific use cases—and anything else that will help them make their final decision.Check out howZendeskcombines web copy, white papers and case studies to share tangible results. This can help a range of decision-makers understand how the service could apply to them before any sales calls are made.For example, right from the home page, you can see awhite paper that explores the ROI of Zendesk.If you have built a mailing list, email lead nurture flows can be highly effective.Once you have a mailing list, it’s important to nurture your users with valuable content.While you can certainly talk about your product, offers and referral programs, you should still give a lot more value to your audience than you are expecting to receive from them.If your emails are useful, practical, insightful, or refreshing, people will stay reading, subscribed, and happy.We love how online design SaaS platformCanvabrings out the creativity of its email subscribers with the following competition:Not only does this showcase the platform in a non-promotional way, but it generates tons of amazing user-generated content on social media. Most importantly, however, it brings users back to the platform.8. Design Lead-Nurturing Content WorkflowsOnce you’ve considered the buyer’s journey and content funnel, the next step is to connect content to build conversion paths.That is, designing ways for your customers to move through the funnel, from awareness through to conversion.Here’s how:1. First, turn to analyticsHere you’ll be able to see which content is most successful. For example:Which content is being clicked on the most? If How-to guides are performing well on social media, it could be an area to concentrate on, for example.Which content brings you the most organic traffic? If you know certain topics outperform others, you know where to invest your resources.Which keywords are you ranking for? Keywords can give you lots of clues as to what content to create next, and for whom.Which content is encouraging newsletter sign-ups? And so on.Make sure to track where people tend to go after reading blogs. You can run experiments by adding different call-to-action buttons (CTAs). This will help you understand which types of content to create, which types of CTAs to use, and how to move your leads down through the funnel.2. Check out the competitionYour competition holds clues as to what works and what doesn’t. Perform akeyword gap analysis, and see what they are ranking for and where you are lagging behind.But also take your snooping further. Download their guides, experience their email flows, read their content, and see what they do on social media.While you can’t see too far under the hood, you will be able to surmise what is working for them and which topics your potential clients might be interested in.3. Work on lead nurtureLead nurturing is the process of taking a lead and giving them value through content, interspersed with easy ways to become a customer.This is especially important for companies that focus more on the sales process and less on self-service.But how does it work?For a start, sending all the leads that just downloaded an ebook directly to Sales won’t be very successful. Instead, you should have a lead scoring system that will only direct to Sales those users that are definitely interested.To nurture them to that point, you need to have special tools and content. For example, you could use an email automation tool and various types of content that would move them down the funnel.It might look something like this:Customers download an ebook, providing contact informationThey open the first email and click on a link, growing their lead scoreThey register for a webinar and explore sales pages, increasing their lead scoreOnce they reach a certain score, their details are automatically passed to the sales team, who can then initiate a conversation about your solutions.9. Focus on Quality, Not Quantity When Creating ContentThe top two factors leading to success in content marketing for our survey respondents working in IT are Search Engine Optimization (56% of responses) and improving the quality of our content (55%).And, interestingly, the most important driver of organic traffic is high-quality content, with 68% of respondents citing this.So how can you create high-quality,optimized content? It needs to do a number of things:It should provide useful, practical, and original information and, at the same time, be relevant to theintentof the audienceIt should also be authentic. Content that’s based on your expertise will always be better than content outside your experience.Content should also be fully comprehensive. Make sure you cover all potential questions and subtopics related to the main topic of the content piece.Finally, content should offer a great user experience. Written content, for example, should be pitched to the level of understanding of the audience, it should include visuals, have short, easy-to-read sentences, and help the user scan with headings.Use theSEO Writing Assistant toolto improve the reader experience on your blog. Analyze each article and get an instant score of your piece across four main pillars: SEO, readability, tone of voice, and originality.You also need to continually assess what’s working well, and what’s not.As such,content auditsare crucial to improving your SaaS content. According to our research, some 65% of companies that succeed in content marketing run content audits more than twice a year.10. Work Out Your Promotion and Distribution StrategyBuilding a smartcontent distribution strategyis as important as the content you are producing in the first place. You need to consider how content will be promoted before the creation process takes place.There are three primary methods of distributing content:Owned channelsOwned channels are the channels that belong to your business (e.g. podcast, blog, mailing list, social media, etc.). These are your own to post on as you will.Earned and shared channelsThese channels are owned by third parties, such as friendly blogs, news websites, forums (such as this dedicatedSaaS Reddit page), and even review sites. These sites are free to post on, but the content won’t belong to you afterward.Paid channelsThese platforms or influencers will promote your product for a fee.The top three SaaS content channels, as outlined in our State of Content Marketing Global Report findings are owned channels: Organic social media (73,5% of responses), organic search (58,7%), and email marketing (55,6%).The key thing to note is that each channel and platform within those groups has its own guidelines and best practices for sharing content. That means content needs to be adapted for everywhere you want to place it.Get it right, and your content will get a lot of impressions, get it wrong, and it will go unnoticed.For example, content for Instagram Reels won’t work well on LinkedIn, long-form blog posts don’t perform well as newsletters, Facebook posts will get truncated on Twitter, etc.Here Are Some Examples of Great Content Distribution:Typeform, a top SaaS interactive form builder brand, focuses on creating live video content on Linkedin.Its video views are in the hundreds, and it has helped to build a decent following of nearly 50,000 people on the platform.Going back to our example of Canva, as you might expect, it has a top-level Instagram game with over a million followers.The brand carefully curates stories and categorizes them (design challenge, Canva live, Q A, etc).Canva also pays special attention to videos and Reels, which must also be created to meet the specific format requirements.Both B2C and B2B SaaS brands can have success posting on channels and forums like Quora, Reddit, Product Hunt, and other industry-focused sites.It's key to make sure you follow the relevant etiquette and guidelines based on each platform.Reddit, for instance, has an uncountable number of subreddits, each with its own rules for posting, with eagle-eyed moderators and bots ready to hunt out promotional or irrelevant content.In the following example, we can see howCloud Daily—supported bySaaStr—performs well with a Quora-focused content distribution platform. Cloud Daily posts upwards of 20 times a week on this platform. It has generated over 380,000 followers as a result.Conclusion: Succeeding in SaaS Content MarketingContent marketing for SaaS companies requires focusing on your audience and their needs, providing high-quality educational content, andmapping outthe entire customer journey.The biggest challenges presented by the industry—such as the complexity of the solutions, longer buying cycles, and a pressing need for education—should be reflected in your content strategy.TheSemrush Content Marketing Platformwalks you through the whole process in a straightforward way.

Overhaul your blogThe blog is dead! Well, not really, but like a phoenix from the ashes, it’s reborn. It’s time to ditch the idea and naming of a blog and make the jump to a magazine if you want to rank on Google.Create a SaaS brand magazine at <brandname>.com/magazine/. These are where your thought leadership content pieces will live. These pieces will position you as leaders in your niche andentertainyour target audience.There are a few brands out there that are doing this exceptionally well. Check outWealthsimpleas a great example of this.SourceThe idea of your SaaS magazine is to take and build on exactly that concept:a magazine. Create content pieces that people enjoy and would happily pay for.You’re not writing for search engine optimization, and Google—at least not directly—you’re writing for your ICP and target audience. What do customers want to read? What do theyneedto read? And, what are you in a position to uniquely write?At the same time, deliver the full magazine package. Accompany your copy with strong, unique visuals. Steer clear of Unsplash, please! We’ve all been guilty of it (us too—here at Skale). If you can create SaaS content with unique and relevant visuals, it will lift your magazine’s experience and value.Next up, create a dedicated section on your website for company news and product updates. Don’t just post them on a “blog.”Google is bored of blogs. Theseupdates and company news features are not part of your company blog, nor are they for your typical magazine reader.We don’t buy a copy of The Economist to hear how they’ve updated their company subscription models; we buy it for thecontent.ActiveCampaignhas an entire section of its website dedicated to product updates. It sits separate from the rest of their content and is a great example of a content site structure that others should follow.SourceNext, for your SEO demand capture content, it’s time to become the expert and shout about it. Build out content hubs for each identified topic that your SEO keyword research deems you need to be a leader of.Benevity(formerly known as Alaya Good) is doing a great job of this with the content strategy that we helped put together for them. As a purpose-driven employee engagement SaaS platform, Benevity has identified pillar content topics they need to be ranking for and writing about.Benevity breaks their content down into these pillars with a selection of articles that deep dive into each one. Benevity breaks them up depending on the reader’s intent and awareness level.They then combine all of this great information intocomplete downloadable guides. It’s the perfect example of demand capture content in full swing.Source“We’ve adopted the content pillar strategy so thatour target audience can more easily find and navigate based on the topic they’re interested in.It’s also great for search engines to find these pages—because even on our internal webpages, they’re all pointing to this hub for a specific topic, sending clear signals to search engines saying, “Hey, look over there, that’s where you’ll find the treasure!”–Stephanie Grawehr, Marketing Manager @ Alaya Good.The last thing on your list?

The content marketing community is very open with its successful methods,playbooks, and strategies. What there is, isunique execution.It’s a great idea to use your customers when creating content pieces. Understand customers’ pain points, and create content that answers those customer pain points.“Too many companies over-index on generic SEO content marketing that ranks for high search volume queries, which is good, butthey don’t spend enough time creating niche content piecesthat their customers will value.”Look to build things like company leadership reports, host statistics, and write articles that engage people—more so than these generic articles trying to hit keyword research.Find the balance, and use quantitative and qualitative user data to forge content that’s valuable, unique, and educational.—Idea provided by:Kevin Indig, Growth Advisor –  ex-Shopify, G2, Atlassian3. Split your SaaS content marketing efforts: 50 50ManySaaS marketing teamsfail to put as much effort into distributing their content as they do with the creation. Think about it; you spend hours, days, maybe even weeks putting together an incredible article, and then you let it sit still in the water.It’s time to make waves and push that article into the hands of potential customers.“The way I’ve been thinking about it and explaining it to other people, as you can just shovel your cake ingredients into a bowl and hope to win the Great British Bake Off, you have to have to put it in the oven. You have to present it.”Source“If you put the time into the creation of your company content, it could be the best article in the world, butif you’re not putting the time into distribution and promotion, you don’t have much chance of getting anywhere after that.Promotion can be an outreach campaign. It can be social media,email marketing, newsletter features, whatever you’ve got to work with.”Take your distribution strategy a step further and create content that resonates with the channel you’re using to share your article on.For example, let’s say you have an epic article on SaaS Content Marketing and want to promote that article on LinkedIn. In this example, you could transform a snippet of that article into video content and share it via a post. Knowing that LinkedIn users are20x more likely to share video content.Find the channel, adapt to the channel, whet the appetite, and win click-throughs.“I also think it should also be on the writer’s to-do list to put the time into the promotion of the article as well. They should be proud of the work they’ve created and want to share it.Even for the articles I write, I put together an outreach campaign. I think it works a little better if I’m doing it on a personal level too. For example, I’ll say I drank twenty-five coffees writing this article, make the caffeine shakes worth it, and let me know what you think!”—Idea provided byKirsty Finlayson, Head of Marketing @ Chameleon4. Do your researchThere are tons of different ways to research your article. There are plenty of SaaS tools out there to help you get the job done, too, a few of which you’ll find at the end of this article. You can also check out our piece onSaaS SEO Keyword Research Methodsfor more.Spyfu monthly domain overview for ChantyOne of the best ways to do qualitative research, if you have the time, is tosearch for the topic/keywords you’re trying to rank for on Google. Take some time to read over the top ten articles out there.“Generally, you’re going to be met with quite a lot of rubbish out there still ranking on the first page in SERP.”Go through each article and ask yourself what you like and what you don’t like about that article. Write down the pros and cons of each article and identify how you can do it better.“Ask yourself, what are competing articles doing that you can one-up and is still going to meet user search intent? Think about how you can make that article shine.”If you’re briefing a freelance writer, highlight the top articles and why you don’t or do like them. This research should make for a more informed piece and one that not only hits intent but has a strong competitive edge to help it outrank the current reigning Google champions.-Another great input from Kirsty Finlayson.5. Develop a conversion keyword strategyMany SaaS companies confuse or don’t segment their keywords when working on their content strategy. They pick keywords that are relevant to their audience but don’t take it any further than that.This research means companies have relevant keywords but are unsure where these keywords come in the customer journey and which words resonate with buyer intent. Conversion keywords are your money keywords and need unique content around them.Identify your conversion keywords by working closely with your PPC team when conducting all of your keyword research. The PPC team has fantastic data sets on what they’re bidding on and what search queries are converting for the business.“A common company mistake is looking at keyword volume instead of focusing on things closer to people making the decision to buy.Focus on intent-based keywords with low volume.For example, conversion to a free trial or even paid plan subscription.Take a keyword that works, then find all the long-tail keywords that have even lower search volume but higher intent.”For example, for ‘SaaS Content Marketing,’ our longtail keywords are:Content marketing campaignSaaS content marketing strategyContent developmentSaaS content marketing agencyJust from that, we’re already making this article more competitive—although you can decide if they’re conversion keywords or not. 😉Level up your SaaS keyword researchLearn how you can scale your SEO ROI with a great keyword research strategy.Read the guideLastly, add personality to the content you’re creating. If you’re writing for conversions, you’re giving a strong insight into what life would be like for someone if they become a customer. You’re delivering an inclusive tone that sheds light on customer success relationships.Exemplify the brand you want to be and the internal treatment a customer can expect. It will forge relationships and help a reader visualize the greener grass on theinside.—Idea provided byVassilena Valchanova, Digital Marketing Strategist.6. Give a reason for people to reference youWhether it’s branding, data, great company imagery, or something else, give your content marketing efforts the best opportunity possible to win backlinks. Try to get picked up and noticed for the content you’re putting out there and work onbuilding organic SaaS backlinksfor quality.What’s more, you don’t just need to win backlinks for the quality of content you provide that’s specific to your niche. You can win backlinks for how you’re conducting your marketing efforts, how your marketing operations run, or for the exemplary style you’re putting out there.SourceDon’t just think that you’re winning links within your field. You can win links fromSaaS marketing agencies, like us, notable awards brands like The Drum, or even graphic designers that appreciate the visuals you’re coupling with your content.Keep your quality and creativity high across the board and get those mentions, shares, and links that your SaaS business deserves.7. Build hypeCreate a total content marketing experience and journey for customers. You can’t jump straight to 100mph in an introduction, and at the same time, you can’t be dragging your heels and saving the good stuff for your final punchy paragraph.Hook people from the first moment, and keep building their interest throughout the piece. Keep peaking! ⛰️“Most businesses think that an interesting introduction to any content is enough to attract consumers. It’s not. You have a piece of content, and whether it’s an email, article, or video format, you have the desired action you want the consumer to take. Scheme your content in a way that it keeps getting more and more interesting until your CTA.”This way, you turn a neutral consumer into a hyped-up, guaranteed lead by the time they reach your CTA. Plus, you’ll decrease the bounce rate and improve your lead conversion in the process.—Idea provided bySelman Gökçe,Inbound Marketing Specialist@ UserGuiding8. Create for a problem, not a solution“A lot of SaaS companies still ignore the fact that people search for their solution when they already consider buying it. For example, a digital marketeer is asked to find an email automation tool. They’ll likely search for this exact term in Google— or even a name of a tool recommended.”Any marketing consultant will say the same, the content you create to answer this search intent isn’t the type of content that attracts awideaudience.“As SaaS content creators, we need to focus on the problem(s) and pain points that our product solves.For example, that email marketing tool can help us: nurture leads, write better emails, or create a newsletter (just to name a few).When we focus on the problem at hand for our content marketing plan, we reach wider audiences while remaining relevant to potential buyers.”SaaS content marketing is not landing pages; it’s building funnels to get there.So in this email marketing solution example, it’d be worth writing content about:How to capture leadsHow to nurture leadsHow to write better emailsHow to start a newsletterKiller subject lines and preview textThese aren’t massively unique examples, and you can certainly create more intriguing subjects depending on your niche, but let’s focus on the thinking model here.Next, make these articles20% about your SaaS productin the context of helping to solve that problem, and 80% info they can use without your SaaS product.Depending on how specific you get with your problem will depend on how close to conversion you get with readers. When you’re super specific, you’re more likely to convert yet less likely to reach a wider audience.Define a goal for each piece of content, metrics to measure that goal, and write for problems that hit that goal.—Idea byPawel Banhegyi, Founder at Map My Growth9. Think about the chain of commandIt’s always so important to remember your reader and their role in SaaS content marketing. The higher up the chain of command your target audience is, the less time they’ll likely have to read or consume long-form content.If you’re trying to reach Heads of Departments, Directors, CEOs, or COOs, for example, you need to find other ways to make an impression.“Try delivering leadership roles with bite-size tips or pieces of info instead of ebooks, webinars, or blog posts. Things like 1-3 min explainer videos, weekly newsletters packed with actionable tips, or punchy social media posts with one key takeaway.Focus on delivering consistency over time, and you’ll make sure your SaaS brand leaves a deep impression that way, rather than one epic skyscraper post they stumble upon.”At the same time, if you’re trying to target specialists, assistants, or coordinators, you can put together more long-form content. These are the types of roles that set aside time to do their research andreallydive in to make sure they’re working as efficiently as possible.Although these people may not have direct access to the cash flow to purchase your SaaS product, they can be your internal brand champion and push your case forward.There’s no right or wrong level of seniority to aim for when it comes toSaaS marketing; it just depends on the content you’re delivering to both.—Idea byEden Bidani, Marketing & Acquisition Specialist @ Greenlight Copy.10. Write for each stage of the funnelFirstly, look for great writers that know what they’re talking about. Onboard them, so they fully understand your product, your target audience, and the area of the marketing funnel they are writing for.Use TOFU content to bring in your target market, BOFU content for brand alignment, and push a unique POV within the market.When you optimize marketing content for MOFU, it’s when you can find incredible success. When you meet people when they need you and a solution you have, that’s when the important SEO work comes in. Especially if you’re in a saturated market, figure out where you’re going to pin your focus and lead this content with SEO.“When I started out at a previous role we just weren’t seeing the click-through rates we’d hoped for with our TOFU content. The issue was, the content wasn’t focusing on the benefit that our product gave the client.We began to reframe our TOFU marketing content for the benefits of what the product does, not the product itself, and we saw much more engagement and click-throughs with our TOFU content.”Focus on your marketing content.Focus on the area of the marketing funnel you’re writing for.Write for what people are looking for within that area of the funnel.Each section of the funnel should have a different goal, and therefore different content to help people reach that goal.—Idea byMeagan Healey, Director, Marketing & Communications @ Dig InsightsLearn from Skale’s SEO winsSee how we 10x’d product signups for Piktochart in just 3 months.Read the case studyWhat makes a SaaS content marketing strategy successful?Content marketing in the SaaS world is no easy task.

In this guide, we’ll lay out a seven-step strategy you can use to conduct a winning SaaS marketing campaign. We’ll cover:Why content marketing for SaaScompanies differs from other industriesWhat goes into a winning content marketing for SaaS strategyHow to identify your target audienceHow to analyze audience pain points for effective marketing and salesHow to set measurable goals for your content campaignsHow to set up an efficient content production workflowHow to distribute content effectivelyHow to monitor and manage the results of your campaignsRead on to learn what you need to know to make your SaaS content marketing deliver profitable results.Why is Content Marketing for SaaS Companies Different?Contentmarketing for SaaSis different than marketing in other industries in a number of important ways:You’re selling both technology and serviceYour marketing must focus on search engine optimizationYour marketing must educate prospectsYour sales rely heavily on reviewsYou must address customer riskYour marketing strategy must promote repeat businessSaaS software is a product, so at first glance, SaaS marketing might seem to revolve around selling a product. However, this is only half of the story. When SaaS customers are choosing providers, a major factor they consider is support quality. This means that SaaS marketing carries the dual burden of selling customers on both the product itself and the support behind it.SaaS buyers research products and services primarily through digital channels, making SEO a critical component of effective SaaS marketing. SaaS audiences typically find products through digital resources such as white papers, website reviews and app marketplaces. Your marketing strategy should include an emphasis on SEO content which will attract buyers from these sources.What Goes into an Effective SaaS Content Marketing Strategy?A winning content marketing for SaaS strategy starts with marketing research and strategizing, proceeds through content production and concludes with campaign performance tracking. This process can be divided into seven major steps:Target audience identificationPain point analysisKeyword analysisCampaign goal setting and trackingContent productionContent distributionCampaign results monitoring and optimizationFor each step, following best practices will yield better results. The remainder of this guide will focus on tips for organizing and optimizing each of these steps.1. Define Your Target AudienceIdentifying your target audiencelays a foundation for a focused marketing campaign. You can analyze your target audience by creating a checklist of questions to categorize characteristics. For example:Is your ideal buyer a business or consumer buyer?What is their gender?What is age?What is their income level?What industry are they in?What is their title?Which other brands do they buy from?Which websites do they visit?Which social media profiles do they follow?Which trade associations do they belong to?Which trade shows do they frequent?Create your own checklist customized for your product and audience. An efficient way to analyze the characteristics of your audience is to use analytics tools to review your social media following. Platforms such as Facebook offer analytics services that allow you to see characteristics of your following in multiple categories in granular detail. You can also use this type of analysis to find other social media prospects who match the characteristics of your target audience.Once you’ve identified the characteristics of your target audience, you can use this information to create a profile of your ideal buyer. Give your ideal buyer a name to put a face on your profile, which can be helpful for brainstorming.In some cases, you may have more than one target market. In this case, you can create multiple ideal buyer profiles. However, creating a large number of profiles will become unwieldy and make it difficult to focus your marketing efforts. Limit yourself to a handful of profiles at most.2. Identify Pain PointsOnce you’ve identified your audience, you can proceed to identify the pain points which motivate your audience’s buying behavior. This will help you gear your marketing and sales strategy towards your audience’s needs.A good way to identify your audience’s pain points is to walk yourself through your market’s experience and the steps which lead them from an interest in your product to making a purchase. You can perform this task by creating a customer journey map. A customer journey map lays out the steps your buyer's experience as they progress through yourSaaS sales funnelfrom prospects to customers. The path of a customer’s journey includes:Becoming aware of your brand and productVisiting your websiteDeveloping an interest in your product which leads to a free trial registration or demo requestConversion to a long-term freemium user or paying customerActive adoption of your productExpanded use of your product by the adoption of new features or supporting products or servicesEscalation of customer service issuesThe decision to renew a subscription or license (retention) or let it lapse (churn)At each step in this process, your customer can encounter pitfalls which impede their forward progress towards retention. Examples include:Failing to recognize a connection between what your brand offers and their needsDifficulty navigating your websiteA poor experience during a free trial or demoProblems with your payment processTechnical frustrations during product onboardingInactive usage of your productPoor customer service experienceProblems with your renewal processFor SaaS marketing, the most critical part of the customer journey is their initial contact with your brand and website. Your marketing outreach must address the pain points which led them to seek out a solution such as that offered by your brand or competing brands.Pain points will vary by industry, audience, and other variables, but some common ones include:Financial pain points, such as low revenue or high expensesLabor pain points, such as excessive work required to use a current SaaS productEmotional pain points, such as frustration with user experience of a current productTime management pain points, such as wasted time due to inefficiencyLearning curve pain points, such as difficulty learning how to use a SaaS solution due to poor training supportTechnical pain points, such as the inability to integrate a SaaS solution with the desired appCustomer service pain points with present SaaS provider or past providersYou can develop variations on these general categories specific to your industry and audience. You may also be able to identify special categories of pain points unique to your audience or industry. Build your audience’s pain points into your marketing content development and your sales material.3. Identify KeywordsAt each stage of your customer’s journey, they may use specifickeywordsto search for the information they need. For example:Before becoming aware of your brand, they may search for information on “how to” solve a problem related to their pain pointsAfter discovering your brand, they may search for reviewsAfter they begin using your product, they may search for information on how to complete the set-up processAs they actively adopt your product, they may search for tips on how to use specific features of your appWhen they encounter customer service issues, they may search for solutionsWhen considering renewal, they may search for instructions on how to renewBy identifying keyword terms typical of each stage of your customer’s journey, you can develop content to address their needs at each point. This can promote more effective marketing and sales as well as higher customer satisfaction and retention.For efficient keyword research, it’s important to use the right tools. Here’s a quick rundown on some of the most important ones:Google Keyword Planner: A fundamental tool that allows you to generate related phrases from a target phrase, identify how much traffic a phrase is generating, and evaluate phrases in terms of competition and cost.Ahrefs: A user-friendly tool which allows you to audit your site’s SEO performance, study competitors and see what’s trending with your audience and industry, plus features to supportlink-building strategies.SEMrush: An all-in-one tool for marketing professionals with functionality similar to Ahrefs, plus advanced features such as the ability to audit competitor performance and backlink profiles.Moz: A competitor of Ahrefs and SEMrush which offers marketing professionals an all-in-one SEO toolkit for advanced keyword research, site audits, rank tracking, and backlink analysis, plus strong support through online tutorials.BuzzSumo: A social media analytics tool that allows you to identify trending topics, popular formats, competitor content strategies, and market influencers.Use these tools to develop a list of keywords to guide content development. For best results, work with a marketing agency experienced with the use of these tools.4. Define Your Campaign Goals and MetricsBefore using your keywords to develop content, you should develop measurable goals for your content campaigns. This will enable you to align your campaigns with your marketing goals and to evaluate campaign performance.Some key performance indicators(KPIs) are standard for content marketing in any industry, such as the number of unique visitors, session duration and bounce rate. These KPIs are also relevant to the SaaS industry. However, a fewmarketing metricsare particularly important for SaaS. These include:Free trial registrations, which can be segregated to identify requests coming from specific pages on your site, such as your blog or resource guides.Software demo requests, which can be segregated in a similar way.Customer acquisition cost (CAC), which measures how your marketing costs compare to the number of customers you acquire for your expenditures.Lead conversion rate (LCR), which measures how many conversions you get per visit to your site, opt-in to your email list or registration for a trial or demo.CAC and LCR use specific equations:Customer Acquisition CostThe formula for CAC can be expressed as:CAC = MC / CAWhere MC represents your marketing costs over a given period and CA represents the number of customers acquired for that marketing expenditure.This can be calculated for total marketing costs, or it can be segregated by variables such as cost per campaign or per marketing channel. For instance, you might track how many acquisitions you generate for your expenditures on developing a particular content piece or promoting your content on a particular social platform. This type of information can help you determine where to best spend your marketing investment.Lead Conversion RateThe formula for LCR can be expressed as:LCR = C / LWhere C represents the number of conversions and L represents lead opportunities, yielding a percentage rate.This can be calculated for different types of conversions and opportunities. For example, you might define a conversion as a free trial registration and an opportunity as a visit to your website and then calculate LCR based on how many free trial registrations you get per visit. You could narrow this down to visits to a particular page on your site if you wanted to track the effectiveness of a sales page, for instance.When you know your conversion rate as well as the traffic volume you’re getting, you know how much you need to invest to generate a specific number of conversions and the corresponding amount of revenue. You can also identify which content is generating the highest conversion rates and focus your investment on promoting it.5. Create Your Content Production ProceduresOnce you know what keywords you need to target and what measurable goals you’re aiming for, you can begin producing keyword-oriented content to achieve your goals. To facilitate content creation, set up a step-by-step production process and procedures. Steps in thecontent productionprocess include:Research topics related to your target audience, customer journey and keywordsCreate a content planning calendarRecruit content creation talentContent creation and editingPublication schedulingFor each step in this process, create and document standard operating procedures. To optimize your procedures, use a project management platform to communicate with your content creation team.When conducting research, don’t neglect the use of voice search as a research tool. This can sometimes speed up your research process.When creating your content calendar, use your audience analysis and list of keyword targets to plan and prioritize your content creation sequence. To attract a wider audience, develop a mix of content for different media, including short-form blogs, long-form blogs, how-to guides, e-books, images and videos. Avoid scheduling content too far in advance, so that you can be agile in making adjustments to recent developments in your market.When recruiting talent, you will get the most leverage if you can recruit freelancers who are thought leaders in your industry. Look for authors of content on topics related to yours.When creating content, set a goal for each piece, such as increasing brand awareness, generating leads or educating your target audience. Draw from your research into audience pain points to ensure that your content addresses your market’s needs.When scheduling content, set a regular, sustainable publication schedule. Estimate how much content you need to create per month to meet your marketing goals and how much you can afford to create with your budget and staff resources.6. Outline Your Distribution StrategyYour distribution strategy defines where and how frequently you will publish and promote your content. Your strategy should address issues such as:Where will you publish your on-site content? Will you index it on your blog, in a resource guide section or elsewhere?Will all of your content be publicly available, or will some be gated for premium users only?What third-party sites will you use to distribute your content through guest blogging or partnerships?Which social media profiles will you use to distribute and promote content?Save time on distribution by using a marketing automation platform to upload content to your website and social media profiles.7. Monitor Your Results and Make AdjustmentsTo ensure that your marketing investment is achieving the results you want, it’s essential to monitor the performance of your campaigns. You can do this by setting up a reporting system which tracks the key performance indicators you established when setting the goals of your campaign. For instance, if your goal is to increase free software trial registrations, include that KPI in your campaign results tracking.Use an analytics software tool with a dashboard that allows you to create customized displays and reports tracking your desired KPIs. Establish a regular review procedure to review the results of your campaigns.If you find that your results aren’t achieving your goals, take the opportunity to make adjustments. Identify which of your content pieces are generating the best results, and focus your marketing budget on promoting them. Use them as templates to replicate your success with other content.At the same time, you can improve the performance of underperforming pieces by doing split-testing to test how making changes affects performance. You may find that a small change such as a different headline, slant or image generates better results.Conclusion:  Follow the Seven Steps to SaaS Content Marketing Success for 2023In this guide, we’ve covered the essential information you need to know to conduct a winning SaaS content marketing campaign.

How to Create a SaaS Content Strategy That Drives SignupsNew PostsTop ArticlesSEO servicesPPC servicesOur CourseWrite for usAboutNewsletterNew PostsTop ArticlesSEO servicesPPC servicesOur CourseWrite for usAboutNewsletterArticlesMenuTweet thisShareRead laterPosted onContent MarketingHow to Create a SaaS Content Strategy That Drives Product SignupsLast modified April 4, 2023ByCameron Brown0 CommentsMost SaaS content strategies focus on top of funnel topics and generating what we call “content conversions” (e.g. email signups, ebook downloads, white paper downloads, etc.), which, notably, is not the same as a product conversion (trial start, demo request, etc.). This is true of strategies used by in-house content marketers as well as agencies and other third party consultants.In our article onSaaS content marketing, we argued that this tendency is based on the typical marketing logic that you need to guide every potential customer through each stage of the customer journey: brand awareness, consideration, conversion.However, there are two fallacies in this approach:For almost every SaaS company, with the exception of those who are truly creating a new category, there is a significant portion of potential customers who arealreadyin the consideration and conversion stages.So why wouldn’t you focus on converting those who are ready to buy first?Generating content with the goal ofcontentconversions (email signups, lead magnet downloads, webinar signups, etc.)assumes that some significant portion of people who sign up to receivemorecontentwill eventually want to sign up for your product. Very often that isn’t the case (or it’s a very small percentage).So, if your goal is to generateactual ROI from content marketing, we think it makes more sense tofocus yourcontent strategyon bottom and middle of funnel topicsfirst— content that’s designed to generate trials, demos, andproduct signups (i.e. paying customers!) —and only after you’ve exhausted those keywords and topics, work your way up the funnel to broader topics.If you want to more deeply understand the thinking behind this strategy,read our original article, which discusses this at length.In contrast to that piece, which is more theoretical, this article will focus on actionable advice that SaaS businesses and content marketers can use to create their own content strategy.In this post, we share:The specific types of keywords we choose and content we create for our SaaS clients (categorized bybottom of funnel,middle of funnel, andtop of funneltopics).For each content type, we link toexamples of live articleswe’ve written for clients that you can go and read, find ranking in Google, and use as inspiration to build your own equivalent content (following the structures used in those articles).The mix of content that we typically prioritize for our SaaS clients in thefirst 3 months of an engagement.Links to our articles on key related topicslike customer research, content writing, promotion and distribution, and measuring performance.But before we get to all this, there’s one other key element of our strategy that we need to briefly explain first, which is our approach to search engine optimization (SEO) andcontent ideation.Note:If you’d like to learn ourcontent strategyand apply it to your business, we teach everything we do and give personalized feedback in ourcontent marketing course and community. If you’d like us to do content marketing for you, then feel free to fill out the form on the bottom of ourwork with us page.Why Our SaaS Content Marketing Strategy is SEO-Focused and Pain Point-Driven (Instead of Volume-Driven)In the early days at Grow and Convert, we had the hypothesis that producing interesting stories and promoting them throughcommunity content promotionwould outperform what most other marketing teams and agencies did. Lots of SaaS companies do this too — a big part of their content strategy involves publishing large guides and whitepapers that they promote heavily on social channels (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.).While we were able to achieve fast results in the short term, we’d often hit a ceiling on the amount of traffic and conversions we could drive because after the initial social and community push, traffic would slow to a crawl.Then, after looking through various client’s analytics accounts, we started to notice a trend that certainblog posts that happened to rank for bottom of the funnel keyword terms would outperform blog posts going after larger volume keywords. At around the same time,content distribution also became harder.For all of these reasons, we ended up doubling down on the idea that:bottom-of-the-funnel, conversion-focused SEO content was the most effective for SaaS companies.The SEO part ensured that if we spent time creating content, it kept getting traffic for years, not just for a short burst after publication. The BOTF part ensured that this traffic led to conversions and ultimately revenue growth.We wrote more behind this story and shift in strategy in our B2B SaaS case study onHow We Scaled Leadfeeder’s Signups to Over 200/month. You can also read our original explanation of ourPoint Point SEO strategy here.Now, let’s get into very specific examples of keywords for bottom, middle, and top of funnel SaaS content topics.Bottom of Funnel SaaS Content: Software Category and Comparison KeywordsAs we’ve said, every SaaS content strategy should start here. These are the core keywords that indicate the target customer is looking to try, or buy, a SaaS product like yours right now — they don’t need to be “dripped” any content or be educated on the space. Think:“Best X software”“[Use case] software”“[Industry] software”“[Competitor] alternatives”These are the keywords that most SaaS brands are bidding on in paid ads and competing for with their competitors, but for some inexplicable reason, aren’t going after organically with blog posts (in our experience).We tend to think about these keywords as falling into two main categories:software category keywordsandcomparison keywords.For both of these categories, there are themes that show up again and again in search engine results pages (SERPs):Who shows up:Typically you’ll see software review sites like G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, etc. You’ll see competitors. And occasionally, you’ll see other peripheral sources who in some way can benefit from showing up for that term (e.g. a marketing consultant showing up for “best marketing analytics software”).Types of pages:Review site pages listing products in that software category. Competitor home pages, product pages, or blog posts. Other bloggers, thought leaders, consultants, etc. ranking with blog posts.Content formats:The most common content format is list articles (because the intent of people searching is to understand theiroptions). The other top content format is conversion-focused landing pages.When we kick off content with a SaaS client, these are two of the first categories where we’ll look for keyword opportunities. Each has different keyword variations which we’ll share examples of and discuss below.Software Category Keywords and Article ExamplesAbove, we mentioned some of the top software category keywords like “Best X software,” “[Use case] software,” and “[Industry] software.” But there are different variations of these that you can play with in your keyword research. For example:“[Industry] + [Use case] software”“[Use case] software for [Industry]”“[Industry] software for [Use case]”The more use cases you have or verticals you serve, the more potential keyword opportunities you’ll have in this category.For example, our client TapClicks has four main use cases (analytics, reporting, workflow, and order management) and serves 3 verticals (agencies, media companies, and retail brands). So, just within the “[Industry] + [Use case] software” variation, they have12potential keywords worth looking at.You can see how as you begin to play with different variations of these keywords, especially if you have a large feature set or serve several verticals, there can be a lot of opportunities injustthis category.And there are even more opportunities when you substitute “software” with “tools” or “apps”, or add additional modifiers like integrations or business size. For example:“Best [Use case] tools”“Best [Use case] apps”“Best [Use case] software for [integration]”“[Use case] software for [business size]” (SMB, enterprise, etc.)“[Business size] [Use case] tools”When doing keyword research for clients, weexplore all of these variationsto find opportunities where a) our clients aren’t yet ranking and b) the search results aren’t overlapping with a keyword we’ve already targeted — or plan to target.Here are some examples of posts we’ve written for software category keywords. For each, you can type their intended target keyword into Google and find them ranking on the first page. You can also click on the link, read the piece, and model the structure in your own content creation.Best [Use Case] SoftwareTargets keyword “best employee time tracking software” for our client Buddy Punch:13 Best Employee Time Tracking Software & Apps for Small Businesses in 2022Best [Use Case] AppsTargets keyword “best video review apps” for our client Vocal Video:The Best Video Review Apps to Collect Video Content Easily and Inexpensively[Use Case] SoftwareTargets keyword “annual leave software” for our client Timetastic:Annual Leave Software: 6 Different Options for Your Company[Use Case] ToolsTargets keyword “media planning tools” for our client TapClicks:Media Planning Tools: An In Depth Analysis of MediaOcean and 4 Top Alternatives[Use Case] Apps with [Feature]Targets keyword “time clock app with GPS” for our client Buddy Punch:7 Best Time Clock Apps with GPS in 2022[Use Case] Software for [Business Size]Targets keyword “delivery software for small business” for our client Circuit:Delivery Software for Small Business: How Routing & Scheduling Optimization Helped 7 SMEs Grow[Industry] Software for [Integration]Targets keyword “HVAC software compatible with QuickBooks” for our client ServiceTitan:Why Most HVAC Software Compatible with QuickBooks Are Insufficient (And How Ours Works Differently)SaaS Comparison Keywords and Article ExamplesThe other main category of bottom of funnel SaaS keywords that we prioritize are comparison keywords, which include both “[competitor] alternatives” keywords and “[brand] vs. [competitor]” keywords.Particularly when we’re working with newer or smaller brands where there aren’t many people searching for their brand versus a competitor, we’ve also had success creating content targeting “[competitor] vs. [competitor]” keywords. In these cases, we’ll create “[competitor] vs. [competitor] vs. [brand]” content to piggyback off the search volume of people comparing our clients’ competitors, and insert them into the list of options being weighed by prospects.The more competitors you have in your space, the more potential comparison keyword opportunities you’ll have. Here are some examples of comparison pieces we’ve written for our clients to see how we approach these.Alternatives ListsTargets keyword “Marchex alternatives” for our previous client WhatConverts:3 Best Marchex Alternatives for 2021Targets keyword “Datorama alternatives” for our client TapClicks:Datorama Alternatives: Comparing the Top 4 Marketing Analytics PlatformsTargets keyword “Dovetail alternatives” for our client Reduct:The Top 3 Dovetail Alternatives for ResearchersBrand vs. CompetitorTargets keyword “Canto software vs Brandfolder” for our client Brandfolder:Canto Software vs. Brandfolder: Compare Two Top-Rated DAMsTargets keyword “RouteXL vs Circuit” for our client Circuit:RouteXL vs. Circuit: Do You Need Route Optimization Software or Delivery Planning Software?Competitor vs. Competitor (3 and 4-Way Comparisons)Targets keyword “CallRail vs CallTrackingMetrics” for our previous client WhatConverts:CallRail vs CallTrackingMetrics vs WhatConverts: In-Depth ComparisonTargets keyword “Katalon vs Selenium” and other variations for our client Rainforest:A Detailed Comparison of Cypress vs. Selenium vs. Katalon Studio vs. RainforestTargets keyword “Housecall Pro vs Jobber” for our client ServiceTitan:ServiceTitan vs Housecall Pro vs JobberMiddle of Funnel SaaS Content: Use Case, Template, and Pain Point KeywordsAs we move up the funnel from keywords that indicate direct purchase intent, there are two qualities that we look for in middle of funnel keywords:Does the keyword indicate that the people searching are in our client’starget audience?Does the keyword indicate that the people searching have apain pointthat our client’s product solves?If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then we can feel confident that a) we’ll reach the right audience by ranking for this keyword and b) there will be a natural opportunity to weave in and sell our client’s product throughout the content we create for it.Three types of keywords that we find consistently have these qualities and work well for SaaS are use case keywords, template or checklist keywords, and pain point phrases.Below, we’ll define each of these keyword types and walk through examples of keywords we’ve targeted for clients.Use Case Keywords and Article ExamplesUse case keywords are keywords that describe or relate to a use case your product helps to facilitate. In contrast to the “[Use case] software” keywords we described above, prospects may or may not be directly looking for a software solution. Often their intent is to understandhowto do that thing or best practices for doing that thing.However, often some portion of people who type in a phrase that directly matches one of your product use casesarelooking directly for a solution. And for those just looking to understand how to better do that thing, you can show them through your content how your product helps them do it better in some way.Here are some examples of articles we’ve created for clients targeting use case keywords:Targets keyword “ad operations workflow” for our client TapClicks:How to Optimize Your Ad Operations WorkflowTargets keyword “automation test coverage” for our client Rainforest:The Snowplow Strategy: Improve Automation Test Coverage in Five StepsTemplate and Checklist Keywords and Article ExamplesTemplate and checklist keywords are keywords that indicate someone is searching for a template or checklist that helps them do a particular thing that your product can help them do better. They’re often phrased as “[Use case] template” or “free [Use case] template” (and sometimes include modifiers like “PDF,” “Excel,” “Google Sheets,” etc.).If you review the examples below, you’ll find that the basic formula we use in this type of content is:Design a free template for readers to download(to satisfy the search intent of readers upfront).Describe the ways in which a template is only a partial solution,or the downsides of relying on a static template to solve that particular problem.Walk through how your product solves that problem better than a template.Here are some examples of template and checklist content we’ve created for clients:Targets keyword “daily standup excel template” for our client Geekbot:Daily Standup Excel/GoogleSheets Template [Downloadable]Targets keyword “HVAC service agreement template” for our client ServiceTitan:How to Streamline HVAC Service Agreements (With Free Template)Targets keyword “delivery driver training checklist” for our client Circuit:Delivery Driver Training: A Checklist to Set New Drivers Up for SuccessPain Point Phrases and Article ExamplesPain point phrases are keywords that indicate someone has a problem that your product solves. “How to” queries are a classic example of phrases that indicate a pain point — the pain of not knowinghowto do something that the person searching needs or wants to know how to do.So if your product helps people do that thing, it’s valuable to rank for that keyword because some portion of people searching may likely be interested in your product, especially if you sell it to them in a compelling way in your article.Here are some examples ofpain pointphrase keywords we’ve targeted for clients:Targets keyword “how to do a poll in slack” for our client Geekbot:How to Do a Poll in Slack (in 6 Easy Steps!)Targets keyword “how to edit video fast” for our client Reduct:How to Edit Video Fast: 5 Tips to Speed Up Video EditingTargets keyword “who is visiting my site” for our past client Leadfeeder:Who Is Visiting My Site? How to Identify B2B Sales Leads That Don’t Fill out a FormTargets keyword “keep track of staff holidays” for our client Timetastic:How to keep track of staff holidays (without clumsy spreadsheets)Top of Funnel SaaS Content: Non-Purchase Intent Keywords That Indicate the Right AudienceOne thing should be made clear: Despite everything we’ve published over the years touting the benefits of bottom of the funnel content,we’re not anti-top of funnel content. In fact, at times we see top of funnel content convert really well for our clients (see screenshot example below). We just think it should come later in the content marketing process since BOTF content is typically so high converting.Depending on the client we’re working with, there are different scenarios in which we’ll begin pursuing top of funnel topics. For example, when we’ve worked with a client for 2+ years and exhausted much of their bottom of funnel keywords. Or, when a SaaS product is very specific and has less bottom of funnel keyword opportunities to begin with.However, there’s a BIG caveat with top of funnel content:Most top of funnel contentdoesn’tconvert well (or at all) because the “ultimate guides,” infographics, and “Tips for X to do Y” pieces that B2B marketers tend to create are super beginner and uninteresting — even off putting — to advanced B2B audiences.These types of pieces rarely sell the company’s product; often the product is not even really mentioned at all in the piece, which almost guarantees a minuscule conversion rate.Here are some examples of top of funnel content we’ve created for clients that have converted well because of the way we’ve reached the right audience and weaved in their product:Targets keyword “daily standup meeting” for our client Geekbot:Daily Standup Meetings: Everything You Need to Know (Standup Agenda, Purpose, Common Pitfalls, and More!)Targets keyword “daily standup questions” (also for Geekbot):Analyzing the 3 Daily Standup Questions: Common Pitfalls & Unique IdeasTargets keyword “how to start a delivery business with contract drivers” for our client Circuit:How to Start a Delivery Business with Contract Drivers in 4 StepsAnd here’s an example of conversion data from one of our clients where top of funnel keywords have been some of theirhighest converting piecesto date:This shows conversion data from Google Analytics’model comparison toolfor a SaaS client from January 2021 to January 2022.The conversion goal we are measuring is “create an account.” This client offers a free account to start and offers paid plans to scale up with more users.The bolded column is measuringfirst interaction conversions, meaning it’s counting the number of users whosefirst sessionon the client’s site started with one of our blog posts — and converted them sometime within the next 90 days.Here’s our full post onmeasuring first and last touch conversions with the model comparison tool.Each row is a different blog post we produced for the client. Rows 7 & 8 reference the same top of funnel post which has generated ~137 signups (the difference between the two lines is a simple URL change we made to the post after publication), making it one of the highest converting pieces to date. And notice the other top of funnel pieces highlighted and how they’vealsocontributed significantly to overall conversions.How We Prioritize SaaS Content Topics in the First 3 Months of a Client EngagementHere’s a video that shares our thoughts on this:Per our strategy described in the introduction, when we first begin working with a SaaS client, we start with a content calendar that includes a mix of bottom and middle of funnel keywords from the categories we shared above.We’ll typically mix in one or two SaaS category keywords, one or two comparison keywords, and a few middle of funnel use case or pain point phrases.For example, here’s a screenshot from Trello showing the first six pieces we tackled for our client Vocal Video:There’s one other piece of content that we do first which we call a “founding story” or “disruption story.” This is a non-SEO piece that we use to drive traffic and conversions early on in an engagement as we wait for our SEO pieces to begin ranking. It also helps us nail down the value propositions and competitive advantages of the product.Disruption stories lay out thespecificproblems that a SaaS business set out to solve when they started their company, walks through how their product works, and most importantly, communicates theirpositioning(i.e. how their product is different or better than other existing solutions).We drive traffic to these disruption stories through paid social media ads (traditionally Facebook ads and increasingly promoted Tweets). Here are some examples of disruption stories to see how we approach them:Producing Video Testimonials Used to Be a Huge Pain. Here’s How We’re Fixing It.How and Why We’re Making Video Editing as Easy as Editing TextAsking Developers to Do QA Is Broken. Here’s Why We Built a Product to Let Anyone Own QA.Why the Large Law Firm Business Model Is Dying and What We’re Doing InsteadOther SaaS Content Strategy Topics: Customer Research, Content Writing, Content Promotion, and Measuring PerformanceIn this post, we focused on sharing the exacttypesof keywords we go after for SaaS clients because we wanted this to be as actionable as possible for SaaS companies.We want you to be able to take what you’ve learned here and develop an SEO-focused content marketing plan that actually has potential to contribute to lead generation.There’s obviously more to SaaS content strategy than just choosing and prioritizing keywords. There are equally important steps beforeandafter that will determine the success of your content (and any inbound marketing efforts).In addition to keyword selection, you need to:Deeply understand your customers’ pain points.Write advanced content that weaves in your product or service.Promote and drive traffic to your content.Measure performance and attributed conversions from your content.We’ve written extensively about all of these topics, so here we’ll link to our top articles on each of them.Customer ResearchCustomer-Content Fit: A Framework for Producing Content That Attracts Customers:This article discusses the problem of misalignment between the topics B2B SaaS marketers choose to write about, and the topics that would actually appeal to their target audience. It shares a concept we coined “Customer-Content Fit” that helps fix this.Content Ideation: Ways to Come up with Content Ideas That Convert:The biggest determinant of whether a blog post will convert is not the call-to-action (CTA) that you place inside of a post, but rather the idea behind the blog post itself. As we explained above, most companies choose content ideas based on the highest volume keywords they can find in keyword research tools (Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, etc.). This article explains what we do instead. It covers tactics for coming up with content ideas including specific questions to ask to people in your company (i.e. sales team, customer service team, CEO and founders, etc.), how to elicit feedback from customers through email, how to find ideas through online communities and your Adwords account, and more.Content WritingSEO Content Writing: A 5-Step Process You Can Follow:This article shares how we define SEO content writing differently than most SaaS marketers, and lays out our process for repeatedly creating valuable content that ranks in organic search and drives leads.The Specificity Strategy: How to Turn Generic Posts into Stand Out Content:People in SaaS marketing always say, “Write great content.” But when you look around online, the typical blogging done by SaaS companies isn’t advanced enough for their audiences. This post explains this problem and our recommendations for what to do instead.Why Your Content Needs “Originality Nuggets” to Be Effective:This article explains a concept we call “Originality Nuggets,” which we define as little bits of originality that make a piece of content unique from others, and thus worthy of being shared or linked to. This piece discusses why we created this strategy, how it’s different from our specificity strategy, and provides examples of how originality nuggets look and work in practice.Why Fully Outsourcing Blog Writing to Freelance Writers is Flawed:This article discusses a key challenge of creating high-quality content — finding great writers — and our take on how to solve this problem.Content PromotionContent Distribution Strategy: Why We’re Doubling Down on Paid Promotion and SEO:This piece covers the shift we made from community content promotion to focusing exclusively on paid promotion and SEO. We discuss our approach to generating short term traffic to articles via Facebook ads, as well as long term traffic via SEO and building backlinks.Measuring PerformanceMost Companies Measure Content Marketing ROI Incorrectly. Here’s Why (and How to Fix It):This article explains our 4-step process for measuring ROI from content marketing efforts. We cover how to define an actual business metric to measure (not a vanity metric like organic traffic or page views), how to set up Google Analytics, how to calculate the number of leads per month needed to hit breakeven on your spend, and how to track progress.Content Marketing Attribution: How to Measure Content Performance:This article explains the different attribution models that are needed to measure content performance accurately in Google Analytics.Want to work with us or learn how to implement our SaaS content strategy?Our Agency:You can learn more about working with ushere.Our Content Marketing Course:Individuals looking to learn how to grow their SaaS business with content can join our private course, taught via case studies,here.

What is SaaS Content Marketing?Summer deal: your first 3 months at $299 instead of $499 for 2 articles/monthTRY NOWServicesSaaS SEOContent StrategyBloggingPricingResultsAboutThe TeamFAQJobsOur StoryLearnKnowledge CenterTech InsightsSpecial ReportBlogTalk to usBook a Discovery CallWhat is SaaS Content Marketing?‍Apart from being a way to communicate valuable information to customers, a big reason SaaS brands prioritize content marketing is this:SaaS content marketingfills their sales funnels with qualified leads.If you're new to this marketing concept and want to know more about what it means and how it can help you grow your SaaS business, you’re in the right place.SaaS content marketing definedTheContent Marketing Institutedefines content marketing generally as "a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience—and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action."That definition lays a solid foundation, but when we narrow it to SaaS businesses, the definition shifts a little.What is SaaS content marketing?When we look at content marketing specifically for SaaS companies, we arrive at a definition more like this:SaaS content marketing is along-term marketing strategythat SaaS businesses implement to attract, convert, and retain atarget audienceby creating and distributing value-packed, unique contentconsistently.Pay close attention to the bold text—we’re going to drill down into each of those themes.1. SaaS content marketing is a long-term marketing strategyContent marketing puts the spotlight on your potential customers—not your software product. So, your ultimate goal shouldn’t be to hard-sell your products but to build a concrete long-term relationship with your target customers.Relationship-building isn't a one-day job. Don't expect to see overnight results.An increase in organic traffic, for example, is one sign that a brand'scontent marketing efforts are paying off. But your blog post won't just hit Google's first page immediately after you publish it. You might have to wait forthree, six, or even over nine monthsto see results.2. SaaS content marketing should appeal to a target audienceSaaS content marketing isn't about attracting heaps of people into a marketing funnel without considering their level of relevance to your business. You'll see positive results from your SaaS content marketing when you produce content for only a specific audience—not for everybody.Let's assume you have a farm management software product. Every piece of content you produce should attract and interest your target audience only—that is, farmers. Deviating from content that appeals to them is a recipe for disaster.If you don’t know who qualifies as the "right audience" in your business,develop a customer avatarto get clarity.3. SaaS content marketing must be consistentContent marketing isn't a one-off exercise. You’ll see positive results only when you produce quality content consistently.It’s critical to keep putting out new, valuable content even as you’re waiting for positive ROI over time from your previously posted content.Playing your content marketing gameconsistently, in the case of blogging, could mean maintaining your weekly or bi-weeklyblog schedule—even if that means outsourcing content creation to ablog writing agency.Content formats to use in your SaaS content marketingAs a SaaS business, you have a range of content formats to explore. Let's quickly look at three popular ones that SaaS businesses use.Blog postsBloggingis an essential content marketing tool for SaaS businesses. And, there are variousblog formatsyou can explore, depending on yourcontent marketing goals. These include how-to guides, comparison posts, and more.VideosVideos are powerful content marketing tools you can use to share insightful information with your audience.SaaS businesses can use videos for lots of different purposes. Apart from publishing them on your blog, you can repurpose them for social media and asother types of content.E-booksYou can use e-books to share industry reports and other in-depth, valuable information with consumers.E-books are also effectivelead magnets. In other words, you can use them as incentives to build your subscriber list.How does content marketing help SaaS businesses?Content marketing can help grow your SaaS company in several ways. Below are a few positive results you can expect when you get on board with SaaS content marketing:Increased brand awareness and authorityPublishing premium-level blog posts consistently will increase your odds of ranking at the top ofSERPs. Higher rankings result in an increase in click-through rates (CTRs) and visibility.A higher ROI (without a massive budget)Businesses spend less money (andreceive 3x more leads) when they embrace content marketing over traditional marketing.(Source)You don't need to break the bank to create quality content. You can assign the task to an in-house team member or sign up with an agency foraffordable premium services.A powerful connection with your customersContent marketing is a tool you can use to build relationships with your customers and move them further down your marketing funnel. And, beyond purchasing your products, a customer who constantly benefits from your content will likely recommend your software products to others.Examples of SaaS content marketingYou'll find excellent examples of SaaS content marketing onBuzzSumo,Ahrefs, and other leading SaaS companies' websites (and social media pages).Successful SaaS companies publish value-packed content regularly to educate their audience and attract potential leads via search engines.OnNeil Patel's blog, for example, he shares in-depth content (blogsandfree courses) that cover subjects that are of interest to his target audience.His content marketing approach brings himmillions of pageviewsmonthly and generates new users for his premium SaaS product—UberSuggest.HubSpotis another top brand that harnesses content marketing to attract qualified leads.

Essentials of a B2B SaaS Content Marketing Strategy - What You Need to SucceedSummer deal: your first 3 months at $299 instead of $499 for 2 articles/monthTRY NOWServicesSaaS SEOContent StrategyBloggingPricingResultsAboutThe TeamFAQJobsOur StoryLearnKnowledge CenterTech InsightsSpecial ReportBlogTalk to usBook a Discovery CallEssentials of a B2B SaaS Content Marketing StrategyWhat You Need to SucceedResearch shows that the SaaS industry is expected to have grown over the five-year period from 2018–2022 at an annual rateof 12%. As a thriving industry, many players are jumping in to get a piece of the pie. The result? The competition is getting stiffer.To succeed, you need an effective marketing strategy that will help you stand out from the crowd.For SaaS businesses, content marketing has proven to be one of the most effective channels for drumming up business. That’s why SaaS content marketing has become a staple for many marketers.What is SaaS content marketing? It’s the creation and promotion of content related to your SaaS product. It serves to:Increase brand awarenessDrive organic trafficEducate your audienceWe’ll touch on how content marketing helps you achieve all this below.The importance of B2B content marketing for SaaS brandsThe SaaS industry is one of the fastest-growing at the moment. Here’s a visual look at the growth trend fromStatista:And with many SaaS brands competing for the same customers, you need an edge over your competition.But you might be wondering: Does content marketing still work?Consider these statistics from a 2018 study conducted byProfit Well:Brands that blog get as much as 67% more leads than brands that don’t.Content marketing helps brands improve customer retention rates by 5–10%.Companies that have a content marketing strategy see around a 30% higher growth rate than those that don’t.The question is not whether it still works, but rather are you doing what’s working?In 2021 and beyond, content marketing for SaaS companies willcontinue to evolve. B2B content marketing will likely remain a critical part of SaaS marketing strategies, because it forms the foundation of inbound marketing.What is inbound content marketing?Inbound content marketing is the practice of creating content to attract the right audience to your brand. It’s the opposite of outbound marketing, where you initiate conversations with your audience by reaching out to them.Why content marketing worksSo why does content marketing work as a SaaS marketing strategy? Here are a few reasons:1. Drives brand awarenessOne of the most important uses of content marketing for SaaS brands is to drive brand awareness. Content marketing can be a great form of PR because it puts your brand in front of many people. It’s also useful for brand recall: The more people interact with your brand, the more they remember it.2. Builds authorityB2B buyers are very picky about the brands they work with. They want brands they can trust. And the best way to gain trust is by building authority—content marketing helps you do just that. Executed well, your B2B content marketing strategy will help you attract a lot of backlinks, helping you build your website’sdomain authority, an important factor in boosting search engine optimization (SEO).3. Educates your audiencePart of the buying journey involves educating your customers about your product and the problems it solves. Content plays a huge role at the research stage, with49% of buyerssaying they prefer to use content when researching their next purchase.4. Drives traffic to your websiteYour website is a lead generation machine. For those leads to come through, you need to lure and hook them with valuable content. This can be content you publish on your website, or guest posts on other sites.Now that you’ve seen the value of SaaS content marketing, let’s dive into how you can pull it off.SaaS content marketing strategy: An overview63% of brandsdon’t have a documented content marketing strategy.Shocking as it may be, this is good news for you.Being among the 37% of businesses that do have a documented strategy gives you a leg up over your competition.Developing a B2B content marketing strategyThere’s more to B2B content marketing than just writing blog posts.So, what is included in content marketing?Developing your brand voiceAudience researchCompetitor researchKeyword researchChoosing the right content formatsCreating a content frameworkDesigning a content calendarContent productionContent promotionAnalyticsThese are just some of the elements that make up a successful content marketing strategy. And, of course, you’ll need to document everything.Read more:Content Marketing Structure for a Busy SaaS Company (In One Hour or Less)Why research is essentialThe first step in developing an effective B2B content marketing strategy is the research stage. Here’s what you should know before you even start creating content:Know your target audienceAudience research is the foundation of your content marketing strategy. It involves:Understanding their pain points or aspirationsKnowing what questions they’re asking about your productUnderstanding the intent behind their search queriesKnowing your target audience empowers you to create personalized content.Competitor analysisCompetitor analysis is the practice of researching your competitors and, in this case, their content marketing strategy. It involves knowing:Who your competitors areThe audience they’re targetingThe keywords they build their content aroundContent types and formatsPublishing scheduleEverything your competitors do that results in positive results is worth emulating. However, you must also note what doesn’t work so you can avoid making the same mistakes.Read more:Why Content Planning Should Never Start With Keyword ResearchKey steps in content developmentWith the research stage sorted, you can now move on to the next phase of your SaaS content marketing strategy: content development.This is the stage where you plan and produce your content. Here’s what’s involved:Establish an editorial missionThe first step in content development is to establish an editorial mission. This is the blueprint that will direct your entire content creation team. An editorial mission answers questions such as:Who are you trying to reach?How will you reach them?What do you want to achieve with your content?An editorial mission ensures that the entire team is working to achieve the same objectives, no matter where they are on your content value chain. It also helps you identify which type of content should be prioritized.Set goals for your contentContent created just for the sake of filling an editorial calendar hardly produces results. You have to set goals for every piece of content you produce for each stage of your marketing funnel.Here are some examples of content goals:Brand awarenessLead generationEncourage trial sign-upsConvert prospects to paid customersCustomer retentionHaving a concrete roadmap for your content goals will result in content that helps you meet your brand’s overall goals.Read more:Blog Goals - How to Set Realistic Growth TargetsConduct keyword researchMost businesses miss the mark when it comes to keyword research. They don’t match their keywords to their audience’s pain points, goals, and intent.Keywords that don’t match user intent may drive a lot of traffic to your website, but in most cases, that traffic will be irrelevant.To attract the right kind of traffic, you have to ensure that your audience research directs your keyword research.And when it comes to keyword research, you need to know that there are two main types of keywords:Short-tail keywords. Also known as “head terms,” these consist of one or two words. In most cases, they’re quite hard to rank for because of the competition to rank for them.Long-tail keywords. These are made up of more than two words. Not only are they easier to rank for, but it’s also easier to match user intent with long-tail keywords.Overall, your choice of keywords must be informed by your audience, your brand identity, and their relevance to your content marketing goals.Optimize headlines and subheadingsCreating optimized headlines and subheadings is another crucial aspect of content development that you must pay close attention to. This is because your headline is the first part of your content readers see when scrolling through the search engine results pages (SERPs).And when they do click on your headline,73% of peopleadmit to skimming through content. They mostly want to see if your content is relevant to what they’re looking for. That’s why you must optimize your subheadings to meet searcher intent. It results in readers digging deeper into your content.Selecting a content frameworkContent frameworks are a part of information architecture and are influenced in part by your editorial mission.Common content frameworks you can employ to structure your blog include:Categories. This is where you group related content under the same categories.Clusters. Topic clusters involve creating content around the same topic and using internal links to connect the pages systematically.Content hubs. A content hub consists of a pillar page and other pages of content built around it. Each page you create must touch on a section that you discuss on the pillar page.The content framework you use has an impact on user experience (UX). A positive UX results in visitors staying longer on your website and encourages them to visit again.How to build organic traffic for your SaaS contentA content marketing strategy involves a lot of pieces that must work together cohesively. And one such element is SEO—driving organic traffic to your content.SEO techniques to support your content marketingLet’s quickly look at some important SEO techniques you need to master to give your content a better chance of ranking.A linking strategyLinks are an important factor search engines consider when ranking content. There are three types of links that you must include in your linking strategy:Internal links. These are the links you create between pieces of content on your blog. Create aninternal linking strategythat helps show search engines which pages are the most important.Outbound links. Outbound (aka external) links point from your posts to other resources. They help establish authority for your blog posts—if you point to reputable resources.Inbound links. Also known as backlinks, these are links from other websites pointing to your website. A couple of ways you can build backlinks include guest posting and alink building outreach.Get your technical SEO rightTechnical SEO refers to the optimization of your website’s technical aspects to improve its SEO. Some important aspects to consider are:Page speed. Page speed is a crucial ranking factor. Improve it by, among other things, enabling compression of files, optimizing images, and using a content delivery network (CDN).Crawlability.Crawlabilityrefers to a search engine's ability to access and move through the pages of a website.Indexability. This refers to a search engine's ability to analyze and add your web pages to its index or collection of web pages. If your blog posts aren’t indexed, they won’t show up on the SERPs.Refresh your old contentAnother effective SEO technique you can use to boost your content marketing is torefresh your old content. This involves:Adding relevant keywords and their synonymsIncluding new statistics and factsAdding new internal linksCheck for broken linksIn some cases, this technique has increased traffic to a post by106% or more.Content promotionSo you’ve hit the publish button on your SEO-optimized blog post.However, publishing a blog post does not guarantee its visibility—you have to promote it.A few ways you can do that are:Sharing your post on social mediaTagging expert sources when sharing on social mediaSending it to your email listSyndicating contentUsingcontent promotion platformsUsing your post to answer questions on relevant forumsPromoting your content ensures that it reaches the right audience. It can also boost your SEO, associal signalsare another indicator to search engines that your content is valuable.Read more:How to Promote an Article: 9 Low-Lift TipsThe ideal publication scheduleFor your SaaS content marketing strategy to be effective, you must stick to a clear publication schedule.

Why Bother?Chapter 2:Content Strategy & AuditChapter 3:Content and the Marketing FunnelChapter 4:Building Your SaaS Content TeamChapter 5:Content IdeationChapter 6:Content CreationChapter 7:Content PromotionChapter 8:Analysis and ReportingChapter 9:Iteration, Maintenance, and GrowthChapter 10:SaaS Content Marketing ToolsChapter 1:What Is Content Marketing for SaaS? Why Bother?In this chapter, we’re going to take a quick look at the basics of content marketing for SaaS: what it is, why it’s important for your business, and why content can be the difference between growth and death.1. What is SaaS content marketing?Running an online business, you’re already invested in basic content marketing: writing website copy, creating landing pages, posting social media updates, and maybe some blogging?But it’s only when you become strategic with content ideation, creation, distribution, and measurement — setting concrete goals and basing your content investments on data — do you enter the SaaS content marketing game.And that’s when you can better reach and connect with your target audience — building greater brand awareness, credibility, and authority that ultimately translates into better organic search rankings, qualified traffic, and lead generation.Content marketing for SaaS is a tad different than marketing in other industries, because:You’re promoting both a piece of technology and a subscription serviceYour marketing strategy must balance focus on user acquisition and retentionYour content must educate prospects and address buyer hesitation (considering your product is intangible)Your users research products and cloud-based services primarily through Google, making SEO a critical part of your content strategyYour user acquisition relies heavily on the value you provide via content, not just your product’s quality (“build it and they will come” is lousy advice.)Now, you may ask…2. Why is SaaS content marketing important?Virtually every SaaS company (both B2C & B2B) is now using content as a part of its marketing strategy to position itself as a niche thought leader by offering helpful, insightful resources to its audiences.The question is, why not continue to rely solely on the old-school cold selling approach?Well, let’s havesome numbersdo the talking:So essentially, effective content marketing means that when a potential customer is ready to invest in a cloud-based SaaS tool, subscribing to your product will be the obvious choice.As you’d realize when you analyze the success of any hyper-growth SaaS (Ahrefs, Shopify, HubSpot, etc.), an outbound sales-y approach is no longer as effective. You need a strong SaaS content strategy to grow sustainably, and our next chapter discusses just that…Chapter 2:Content Strategy & AuditThe best trips can often be impromptu and unplanned, but that’s not the case with the best-performing content that ranks high and drives impressive amounts of qualified traffic.In this chapter, let’s understand what goes into creating an effective SaaS content marketing strategy — which is the basis for producing high-performing content consistently.1. Define your content marketing goalsAs the saying goes, life without goals is like a race with no finish line; you’re just running to nowhere.Likewise, you can’t score with your content efforts if you don’t set concrete goals.So, set SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound) goals, such as:With clear goals, the next step is to…2. Define your metricsIt’s easy to get swamped with myriad metrics that don’t really matter to your business growth.Based on your SMART goals, focus on tracking only the key content metrics that help evaluate the success of your marketing activities, replicate wins, and minimize wasted efforts.Here are a few SaaS content marketing metrics you can consider to define your broad KPIs set:To track all these metrics, tools like Google Analytics and Ahrefs would suffice. We’ll discuss tools and content-level metrics in later chapters.3. Define your ideal customerAn ideal customer profile (ICP) is a detailed description of the company or user that will benefit the most from your SaaS product.These are prospective customers that would be the quickest to convert, and likely to stay loyal to your brand. Defining your ICP requires chalking out their key audience characteristics, such as:Once you’ve defined the characteristics of your target audience, you can use the data to create a profile of your ICP. Give a face to the name and use it for all content brainstorming.If you have more than one target market, you can have multiple ICPs. In such cases, try to limit yourself to a handful of profiles at most, otherwise, it can become difficult to focus your content marketing efforts.So the question is, what do your ICPs want to read? What are you in a position to uniquely and expertly write (and design)? To get started, you need to first…4. Audit your existing contentWith your content marketing goals, KPIs, and ICPs in place, it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty of your existing content.Step 1: List existing contentUnless your SaaS website is freshly launched, you likely already have a few content pieces on your blog or resources page.So the next step is to understand how well that content is helping you to meet your goals.List your existing content to figure out:Who is your content targeting?How is your content performing in terms of your defined content marketing goals?What are the top keywords your pieces are ranking for?What types and topics of content are you missing?What are the content pieces you should update, merge, repurpose, or delete?How does your content compare with that of your competitors?Answering these key questions is necessary to produce an effective SaaS content marketing strategy. Here’s how you go about it…Step 2: Organize and tag your contentUsing a tool likeSEMrush Content Audit, you can analyze your website or blog content in just a few clicks. You can also assess other types of content, such as video, PDF, landing pages, social media, external contributions, or interactive content (such as quizzes).Image source via unknownThe tool collates your URLs based on your sitemap data and lets you catalog your content in terms of:Topic, type, and formatFunnel stageMetadata (title, meta description, H1)Word countToneBacklinks and social sharesAuthorDate of publicationAnd moreImage source via unknownYou can create customized content sets, group them by specific metrics, and export your content audit results as a .xlsx file.Connect your Google Analytics and Search Consoleaccounts to see more performance data, such as sessions, average session duration, unique page views, average time on page, bounce rate, and search queries.After collecting metrics, your content audit spreadsheet can look like this.Step 3: Add success metricsNext, it’s time to evaluate the usefulness of your content. Consider success metrics like:The number of inbound links to the contentGoogle rankings for relevant keywordsThe number of social shares and organic traffic receivedBounce rate and average time on pageTie these success metrics of individual content pieces to the overarching content marketing goals you set earlier. And then…Step 4: Analyze the data for patterns and gapsTry to answer some key questions such as:Based on your analysis, decide whether to:Keepyour content piece as is.Updateyour content piece (with the latest research, stats, examples, tips, CTAs, etc.).Deleteyour content piece (due to duplication, irrelevancy, low quality, etc.).That’s all about auditing your existing content. Coming back to the strategy side of things, don’t forget to…5. Align your style with your brand’s personalityThink about how to reflect your brand’s personality and style in the content you create. Because while anyone can copy your content or product, they can’t easily capture your brand’s personality which makes your SaaS unique.The topics you cover with your content are likely already covered by others hundreds of times.So, success with content is largely about how you present your ideas and insights by establishing your brand’s unique personality and tone of voice.To align your content with your brand’s voice, think about how:Would you describe your brand if it were a person?Would you represent your brand in a couple of emojis?Would you want people to perceive your brand when they read your content? (witty, professional, casual, edgy, etc.)Keeping a consistent tone with all content you create and distribute is vital to building trust with your audience and leaving a lasting impression.6. Document your strategy and create an SOPJust41% of B2B marketerssay they have documented content marketing strategies.Without a concrete, well-documented strategy, you’re shooting in the dark and those rankings and lead generation goals are essentially nothing more than dreams. It means no action plans and no way to measure your content efforts.And so, all your goals, KPIs, ICPs, audit results, content formats, and topic ideas should go into a shared document that also outlines:Your team’s content creation process (from ideation and writing to editing and publishing)A flexible content calendar (usethis HubSpot template) with a publication scheduleSite-level keyword research and competitor content analysisYour content distribution plan with promotion channels (email, social media, outreach, etc.)Your SaaS content strategy document should guide all of your content choices and establish the “why” behind all your content marketing efforts. While execution, if any of your content efforts don’t satisfy the “why”, drop it.Also, for each step in your content creation process — ideation, research, writing, designing, editing, publishing, promoting, repurposing — create a standard operating procedure (SOP).Your SOPs would be a set of step-by-step instructions to help your content team execute with more efficiency, deliver quality output as per defined standards, and maintain branding consistency in everything they create.With a documented content strategy and SOPs in place, it’s time to understand how you can map your content to your conversion funnel…Chapter 3:Content and the Marketing FunnelBefore getting into content creation or hiring a writing roster, consider how you can use content marketing for different stages of your SaaS sales funnel.In this chapter, let’s learn how to map your content to your sales funnel, looking at some live examples from successful SaaS businesses.1. Discovery: The Top of the FunnelThe first stage of the funnel is all about creating content that improves your brand awareness and organic search visibility.Here, your audience is using non-purchase intent keywords that indicate their desire to learn about a topic and find actionable advice they can apply to solve their problems.A typical top-of-the-funnel SaaS content strategy can include the following types of content:How-to guidesListicles (tips, tactics, trends, examples, etc.)Infographics (with supportive blog posts)Thought leadership (experience/anecdotes-based content from founders)Original research or studiesIn all these pieces, focus on educating your audience and building credibility.Optimize each piece with the right set of head and long-tail keywords. Answer the questions they ask on Google (we’ll cover the tools for these later). Lead them to relevant product/features pages on your website with contextual internal links and CTAs.Here are a few examples of top of the funnel content from our own blog:How to Use Webinars to Grow Your SaaS Business10 SaaS Marketing Trends You Can’t Ignore in 2022YouTube Marketing 101: The Ultimate Checklist to Skyrocket Your YouTube Channel in 20212. Consideration: The Middle of the FunnelThe next stage of the funnel considers the segment of your audience that is aware of the exact problems they wish to solve and researching potential solutions, likely in the form of the following content types:Product comparison articlesFAQsChecklistsCheatsheetsTemplatesMiddle of the funnel content is similar to the top of the funnel content but with a stronger focus on:Guiding prospects in their product research phaseMaking them aware of your SaaS offeringsTurning them into leads by encouraging them to subscribe to your email list, download a free resource, etc.The same practices mentioned above apply here, and here are a few examples of such content:Website Redesign SEO Checklist for 2022 [DFY Spreadsheet](see the free template we created below)A 25-Point Content Audit Checklist for Better SEO and Content StrategyDecoding SaaS PR in 5 Easy Steps3. Conversion: The Bottom of the FunnelThe final stage of the funnel is where your audience is primed to convert. They’re ready to try or buy a SaaS product like yours.And so, your content’s purpose is to nudge prospects or leads to sign up for your free trial/plan, request a demo, or contact your sales team.Your bottom of the funnel content needs to demonstrate with proof and/or success stories exactly how your SaaS product can solve your users’ specific challenges. It could take the following formats:Case studiesUse casesWhite papersFeatures or integrations landing pagesAlternative lists or product comparison pages (your brand vs. competitor)TemplatesFor your BoFu content to show up on search results, you need to optimize your pieces with the following types of keywords and their variations:“Best X software” | “Best X apps”“[Use case] software” | “[Use Case] Tools”“[Industry] software”“[Competitor] alternatives” | “[Competitor-`1] vs. [Competitor-2] vs. [Your Brand]”“[Use Case] Apps with [Feature]”“[Industry] Software for [Integration]”These are the keywords that most SaaS businesses are bidding on via PPC but often fail to target effectively with organic content. Here are a few examples to take inspiration from:A Detailed Comparison of Cypress vs. Selenium vs. Katalon Studio vs. RainforestCanto Software vs. Brandfolder: Compare Two Top-Rated DAMs3 Best Marchex Alternatives for 2021The Best Video Review Apps to Collect Video Content Easily and Inexpensively360Learning Saw 167% Blog Traffic Growth by Experimenting with Various Content Forms4. Retention: Beyond the FunnelYour content helped convert prospects into users? Awesome. But that’s not the end of it.Once you have customers, your goal is not just to retain them but further convert them into brand evangelists that don’t get swayed by the competition.Put differently, at this stage, your content’s focus is to ensure users continue paying (or even better, upgrade their subscription plan as they grow) while also spreading positive word of mouth about your SaaS.The following types of content can help retain users and reinforce their experience with your SaaS:Exclusive industry analysis content and researchPersonalized product and support adviceInsider tips and tactics via email dripsIn-depth knowledge base to enable self-service and tackle FAQsFor example, Userpilot, a B2B SaaS product growth platform, maintains an up-to-datesupport centerthat covers most of the customer service queries they hear on a daily basis, in the form of easy-to-understand how-to articles.Such content improves the brand experience their existing customers have, thus boosting retention and word of mouth.Chapter 4:Building Your SaaS Content TeamYou’re just a couple of chapters in, but we’re sure you can already appreciate the fact that SaaS content marketing isn’t a one-person job.You need a dedicated and capable content crew to get things right, stay consistent, and scale results.In this chapter, let’s see how to build a basic content team to get started with your content marketing, and how to pick a content management system (CMS) to manage content publishing and SEO efficiently.1. Find the right people for your content teamThe rules for hiring a content team aren’t set in stone, as it all depends on your brand’s budget, needs, and goals.That being said, if you’re serious about content-led organic growth for your SaaS, here are the roles you need to hire to build a powerful content team:Besides posting your requirements on LinkedIn and Twitter, here are a few great platforms you can explore to find the top remote talent for each of these roles:SuperpathProBloggerRemote OKWe Work RemotelyFlexJobs2. Consider how will the team change as your SaaS growsWhen you’re just starting out with your content marketing, you likely won’t build a complete team with all the skills sets in one go. You’ll probably start with a SaaS content strategist, an SEO, and some in-house or outsourced writers and designers.But as your business and marketing budget grows, you need to figure out what skills or personnel are the best fits for your goals, then make those skills and positions a priority when hiring new members while also revising the responsibilities of existing members.Put simply, success in content marketing for SaaS relies more on a commitment to consistent quality than it does on the size of your marketing team.So, don’t focus on how big of a team you can build, but more on producing the most impactful content (in the right formats) you can with the team you can build.3. Outsource to a SaaS specialized agencySpeaking of outsourcing, this may be a good route if you’re looking to have scalable content creation and promotion systems in place right from the off.By outsourcing your SEO content campaigns to an agency, you essentially get an experienced team of strategists, writers, editors, designers, and link builders in one go, who you can rely on to develop successful content campaigns.Partnering up with an agency that specializes in content marketing for SaaS allows you to take advantage of their established processes and expertise for a fixed monthly retainer.It lets you focus on other important areas of your business instead of investing time and effort into constantly vetting, hiring, training, and managing members to build an adept team.PS: Finding and partnering with the right SaaS marketing agency isn’t a straightforward job.

Choose a content management systemIf the first thought that pops into your head is “WordPress?”, then we concur.WordPress is used by43.2%of all websites on the internet, and powers 36.28% of the top 1 million websites (such as TechCrunch and BBC America) in terms of traffic.Many enterprise SaaS brands such as Evernote useWordPressto host their blog.It’s super popular for a good number of reasons and using it ourselves, we can vouch for it:It’s free and open source so you can customize its design to your exact needs. It is also easy to install and get started with.It boasts 60,000+ plugins for just about every need. Powerful plugins such asYoast SEO,AMP,W3 Total Cache, andSmushenable your team to easily tackle almost every aspect of on-page SEO and content optimization.It’s easy to use and inherently SEO-friendly.But if for some reason you aren’t into WordPress, then other good CMS options you can consider includeGhostand theHubSpot CMS Hub.Chapter 5:Content IdeationGreat content brews from great ideas.Researching the right topics — ones that solve your audience’s needs and pains — is the biggest determinant of whether your pieces will drive traffic, engagement, and conversions.In this chapter, let’s understand what to look for when researching content ideas and what makes great content that ranks and converts.1. Develop a keyword strategySure, keywords are important. These are the terms your prospects enter in the search bar to find relevant content.But before diving into keyword research, ponder a couple of questions:What are the most common questions my audience has?What topics are they trying to educate themselves about?You’ve already defined your ICP and ideal audience characteristics. And when it comes to ideation, remember: for conversions, the topics you choose are more important than traffic. Don’t prioritize keywords by search volume, but rather by the pain points of your target customers.With that in mind, the first step is to know your prospects’ pain points. Then, come up with content ideas based on your understanding of their pain points, and finally dig up keywords that you could target in those pieces.Here are a few ways to understand your prospects’ pain points:Talk to and survey your existing customers (using Twitter/LinkedIn polls, emails, or even calls)Have your content team take inputs from your sales and customer-facing teams about common customer questionsJoin communities (on Reddit, Quora, Facebook, Slack, etc.) where your customers would hang out and note the questions and challenges they haveLook inside of your Google Ads and social media ads accounts to see what keywords are converting best to plan in-depth content around those keywordsOnce you find patterns in commonly asked and discussed questions, use cases, and problems, prepare a list of tentative topics.Finally, based on the topics, it’s time to dive into the actual keyword research, which is an extensive task in itself. Go through thisgreat guide on doing keyword research using SEMrush and keep it handy when executing.2. Where ideas come fromWe just spoke about preparing a tentative topics list based on your prospects’ pain points. Now let’s talk a little more about coming up with specific topic ideas for your content.How do you get content ideas beyond the first few obvious keywords? Here are a few tips and tools to generate great topic ideas.Brainstorm topics based on keyword researchAs you do keyword research for a tentative topic, you’ll likely find further subtopics or new peripheral topics that you can cover in-depth as individual content pieces.Your content team can hold group brainstorming sessions during or after the research process to come up with additional ideas:Keep an open field to let creative ideas flow without hesitation from the members.Encourage ideas that are goal-oriented and could inspire action from prospects.Capture all ideas on a whiteboard and/or record the session. You can use a free tool likeMiroto host collaborative whiteboard sessions with distributed content teams.If you implement what you’ve read so far, you’ll have a nice repository of tentative and broad topic ideas. It’s time to pin down some specific, result-oriented content ideas to move to the creation stage by doing…Competitive researchCompetitor research is a rather obvious yet great way to get topic ideas that are doing well with your audience. You’re probably already reading your competitors’ content and trying to decipher if what they’re doing is working or not.Below, let’s look at a few key questions you need to consider when analyzing your competitors’ content.Note that you should ideally evaluate not just your direct business competitors to understand their strategy and top-ranking topics but also content competitors — i.e. other websites such as niche blogs, online magazines, and news outlets that are ranking for the keywords you’re targeting.What’s getting links?As we said earlier, inbound links are the lifeblood of your SEO. They are a direct ranking signal and help drive referral traffic to your content.So when analyzing a competitor’s piece, one of the most important things to look at is which of their content has the most backlinks and from which websites.Enter a competitor’s domain inBuzzSumo’s Content Analyzerto check their best-performing pieces in terms of backlinks and social engagement. Or, enter a broad topic idea or keyword to find the best-performing pieces and try to build upon those ideas to come up with high-value topics.You can also use theBacklink Analytics toolto see your competitors’ backlinks and top referring domains to base your topics based on backlinks performance.What keywords are top traffic earners?As a part of your keyword research, keep an eye on your competitors’ top-performing content in terms of monthly traffic earned.After all, one of your primary goals with content is to drive more traffic to your SaaS and improve brand awareness.UseSEMrush’s Traffic Analytics toolto explore competitors’ traffic stats for individual pages and to reveal their most popular content pages. Furthermore, get a list of all common and unique keywords they rank for by doing aKeyword Gap analysis.PS:If you’re wondering, we aren’t affiliated with SEMrush in any way 🙂What’s trending?Stay on top of trending topics and news in your industry to create content that’s more likely to be shared and linked to.UseGoogle Trendsto search terms related to your niche, check their popularity, and find related topics and terms that are growing in popularity. Then, weave those topics into your SaaS content strategy. For example, if you’re a conversational AI SaaS platform, then the latest advancements and trends in machine learning can make for a good topic.Track topics and terms that matter for your business by setting up email alerts in tools likeGoogle AlertsandBuzzSumo.Doing so can provide you opportunities to donewsjacking— using content to quickly capitalize on breaking news in a relevant way. It involves creating content in connection with a big story to ride its popularity wave and thus garner more traffic, comments, backlinks, and shares.Who follows whom on social media, and what do they share?Check out your top rivals’ social media presence, especially on Twitter and LinkedIn (the prime platforms for B2B and B2C SaaS).Use a tool likeFollowerwonkto analyze the tweets of your competitors and their followers to see what their audience tweets, retweets, and comments on the most, along with who they mention most often.This should help you come up with topic ideas that your audience is more likely to engage with.What types of content are the top brands writing?Keep tabs on what your top rivals are creating on a regular basis.By content types, we mean:Blog postsProduct comparison landing pagesWhite papersInfographicsLong-form guidesNewslettersEtc.Check what content your top competing brands are ranking well for on the SERP, and what content they’re promoting via PPC ads on Google and social media.If your competitors are paying to promote specific pieces as ads, rest assured these are topics worth pursuing.To analyze your competitors’ PPC ads and SEO keywords, use a tool likeSpyFu.Then, to outrank and outperform your competitors on those topics,use the Skyscraper Technique:List down your competitors’ best-performing content (topic and type) in terms of backlinks(and thus, SEO rankings)Create a piece that’s far superior (more comprehensive, recent, data-backed, visually appealing, etc.)Reach out to relevant publications and sites that have linked to your competitors’ content and get links from themDo competitive research beyond the blogCheck out your competitors’ other marketing channels, such as:Note patterns in their best-performing content (most liked, viewed, shared, etc.) and make those topics a part of your own content plan.3. What makes great content, and why most content failsYou want to publish “quality content”. Your competitors want to publish “quality content”.Your audience won’t settle for anything less than “quality content”.But what does “quality content” really mean? In terms of your SaaS blog, a combination of the following factors makes your content good quality (and SEO-friendly):Relevant and recentAll else equal, Google tends to rank recent content higher than older content. So, use the latest research and data in your pieces and keep revisiting your old pieces to update them to include recent, relevant information.Long-formIn the age of decreasing attention spans, “bite-sized” or short-form content (infographics, videos, etc.) will always have a space in your content marketing strategies. However, when it comes to business blogging, long-form pieces (1200-1500+ words) tend to perform better in terms of organic rankings, traffic, backlinks, and social shares.Why? Because of reasons such as:You can target a range of keywordsIt displays your brand’s authority and credibility on the subjectIt’s typically more comprehensive and useful for the readersSo, aim to make every piece as in-depth as possible (but don’t add useless fluff for the sake of word count!).Targeted to a specific personaYour content can truly resonate with your audience only if it’s carefully crafted keeping their wants and needs in mind. For each piece, if you’re strategic about topic ideation (as discussed above) and understand your ICP, then you’re on the right track.EvergreenCovering the latest trends and newsjacking can certainly have a place in your content strategy. But if you’re playing the long game, evergreen content — timeless pieces that stay relevant for years — wins in every regard (SEO, brand awareness, thought leadership, usefulness, etc.).For example, here’s ourevergreen piece on Tesla’s marketing strategythat ranks first and also shows up as a featured snippet for competitive keywords such as “Tesla marketing strategy”, “Tesla marketing”, and more.PersonalThe best content connects with your audience on a personal level. It reads as if you’re conversing with your readers on a one-on-one level. It triggers positive emotions with little-to-no corporate-speak, using plenty of real-life examples, images, statistical evidence, and anecdotes.Most content from budding SaaS brands fails to drive the desired results because it fails to hit the nail in most of these regards (assuming the initial overarching content strategy is solid). And so, keep these points in mind as you move on to the next chapter on content creation.Chapter 6:Content CreationYou’ve done your keyword research and have a list of high-potential content ideas for various stages of your conversion funnel. You have also assembled your content team.In this chapter, let’s look at how to go about content creation the right way. The first step is to…1. Create editorial calendarsIn the second chapter, we mentioned including a content calendar (using thisHubSpot template) when documenting your content strategy.That’s because your content marketing success largely depends on how consistent you are in publishing and promoting your content.Consistently putting out quality content hints to Google and your prospects that your SaaS is a reliable and active source of credible information. It helps improve your domain authority and rankings.So, your content creation activities should ideally stem from an editorial calendar that clearly describes as many of the following details as possible for each content piece you plan:We include most of these details in the editorial calendar spreadsheet that we use for our own website content creation at Growfusely.In this way, you establish a content posting schedule that helps your team stay on track and on the same page.2. Find great writers or outsource to the right agencyOnce you have an editorial calendar in place, it’s time for your writers and designers to get cracking with content writing and design.In chapter 4, we discussed how to find the right people for your content team, which included writers, editors, and designers. Specifically, here’s what you should look for when hiring writers (freelance and/or in-house):A positive answer to all these questions means you’re looking at a potentially great writer that can turn your content ideas into powerful published pieces that move the needle.We also talked about why outsourcing content work makes sense as a growing SaaS business.Outsourcing to a content agency enables you to leverage a proven and scalable content writing system.Instead of hunting individual content writers one by one, hiring the right agency (that will likely also supply you with editors, designers, etc.) is a one-and-done thing. It can help you put your content creation on autopilot so you can focus on your overall marketing strategy and other areas of business.Self-promo alert: Again, finding and partnering with the right SaaS content writing agency is arduous. But you don’t really need to look any further, as Growfusely specializes in SaaS content writing. We have helped over 40 SaaS businesses scale their organic search visibility and traffic with content. See ourclient winsor claim yourfree customized marketing plan today!3. Tools to help with content creationThere are countless tools your content team can use to tackle the content creation process.We’ll share a few top ones that we use, but be sure to search the web for alternatives that might better suit your team’s needs.Editorial calendarsYou can create your own content calendar in a Google spreadsheet based on the elements summarized above (or use the HubSpot template).But you can also explore other tools likeTrello(we switched from Google Sheets to Trello to manage our website’s content workflow in the simple Kanban way) orCoSchedule.See what our editorial calendar looks like:You can move cards from one stage to the next (ideation, outline, etc.), set due dates, tag members, create labels, and a lot more — it’s as simple and streamlined as it gets!Ideation and researchOur go-to tool for content ideation is theBuzzSumo Content Analyzer. It lets you find and analyze the most engaging articles, blog posts, and infographics on the web. It also helps you find relevant influencers and creators for content collaboration opportunities.Next, we use theAhrefs Content Explorertool to analyze the top-performing niche content based on traffic, shares, and referring domains. The tool lets you:Discover low competition topics with high trafficFind topics with backlink opportunitiesCheck domain ratingsGauge social shares, organic traffic performance, and other key SEO metricsFind guest blogging opportunitiesAnswerThePublichelps you brainstorm the questions your audience is searching for. Type in your keyphrase and the tool then generates a set of questions about that phrase and suggests some potential topics.Social forums and community Q&A websites likeRedditandQuoraare also a goldmine to learn about the popular questions your audience is asking, trending topics, debates, and discussions.And if you can, surveying your existing users about what kinds of topics they’d like you to cover with your content is one of the best ways to come up with winning, failproof content ideas. Tools likeSurveyMonkeycan come in handy for this.Format and IllustrationsIf you plan to explore multiple content formats besides plain-text blog posts, then here are some must-have tools:Canva: An extremely easy-to-use graphic design tool to create quick social media posters, flyers, banners, thumbnails, presentations, and infographics.Ezgif: An intuitive online GIF maker and image editor.Involve.me: A no-code interactive content creator for lead generation quizzes, surveys, calculators, and forms.CalculoidandIonare a couple of neat alternatives you can explore.Unsplash,Pexels, andPixabay: While it’s best to use stock visuals sparingly, these are great websites to get free, high-quality images, vectors, and videos.4. Focus on quality, not quantityPut simply, mediocre content will hurt your cause.Whatever you do, don’t become a content mill that churns out so-so content for the sake of jumping the business blogging bandwagon.In fact, it’s better to produce no content than bad content, because the latter can prove to be counterproductive — your brand’s reputation can go down in the eyes of Google and prospects.Your goal is to get noticed for the right reasons — and that means your website should become an authoritative resource that’s known for producing quality content.We’ve already discussed what are some of the key elements that constitute quality content — ensure your SaaS content strategists and writers work accordingly. Producing quality content also involves…Proofreading & EditingTypos may sound trivial but can be an instant turn-off for many readers.So, any content your team produces must go through at least one round of edits, wherein ideally, someone other than the author reviews the piece for structure, typos, grammatical mistakes, and factual inaccuracies.Many content writing teams peer-edit each other’s work, which can also work. Some prefer to have a dedicated editor or two to ensure everything that goes out is perfect.Ensuring proper basic SEOGooglebot is now more than capable of understanding natural language, but keywords still and always will play a considerable role in ensuring your piece reaches the first page of search results.Besides keywords, the overall page experience (load speed, usability, etc.) and the credibility of your content are the deciding factors for SEO performance.So, before publishing each piece, ensure the writer has:Working with design/developmentThe best content isn’t created in a silo.How well your content performs in search is closely linked with how well it appears structurally and visually — your visitors likely won’t return to an unappealing page even if it has well-written content.So, your content team would often need to work with designers and/or developers to ensure the content (such as infographics, landing pages, etc.) comes out exactly the way they envisioned it. Here are a couple of quick tips to keep these teams on the same page:Encourage both teams to share open and actionable feedback on each other’s work and ask questions without hesitation.Have a mediator that ensures the content writer is able to clearly communicate what they expect from the final design.Your content is ready. It’s time to get it the attention and backlinks it deserves…Chapter 7:Content PromotionCreating great content is only half the battle.Your content team can’t kick back with a beer and call it a day once the piece is ready.It’s time for the marketers to step in.Even if your SaaS is well-established and has an engaged social following, you need to invest in promoting your content to your audience (not just existing customers) to drive more referral traffic and conversions, as well as to gain backlinks for SEO.In this chapter, we’ll cover the basics of content promotion — some strategies and channels — linking to some helpful resources your team can refer and use to nail content distribution.1. Building an audienceYou defined your audience in your content strategy and created content as per their profiles, pain points, motivations, and questions.Now it’s time to reach that audience and make it your audience — people that remember your brand, come back for more content, convert into users, and stick by as loyal customers.Here are five channels you need to focus on.Influencer marketingFor SaaS content promotion,influencer marketingis different from the usual Instagram influenza campaigns.Here, we are talking about two techniques:Blogger outreachThis tactic involves partnering up with reputable bloggers in your SaaS niche to create high-quality promotional yet authentic content that talks about your SaaS product.The blogger creates (or helps with creation) and promotes the content for you on their website in exchange for compensation in the form of, say, a year’s worth of free subscription to your software.The content can be a listicle that prominently mentions and links to your product, a dedicated product review, or a giveaway wherein the winner(s) gets a free subscription to your product.Read this article onblogger outreach best practicesfrom our founder. To dig up the right opportunities (blogging influencers, their contact info, topic ideas, etc.), use outreach tools likeBuzzStream,BuzzSumo, andHunter(tofind anyone’s email address).Expert-led roundup contentThis tactic works great for SaaS businesses. Like blogger outreach, you get help with content creation as well as promotion and link building.The idea is simple: find experts on the subject, reach out to them via email to ask 2-3 questions on the topic, and compile their insights into a comprehensive long-form article.Sure, you need to account for the additional time needed to find experts, get in touch with them, and get their answers, but once your post is live, all that effort would be worth it.Because those experts would love to promote your article on social media and link back to it from their own content. This would boost your brand’s reach, land you juicy links, and reinforce your brand authority and credibility in your industry.In fact, we use this tactic for our clientJetOctopus, a fast-growing SaaS technical SEO tool. On their blog, you’ll find expert-led articles on all things SEO. We reach out to some of the biggest SEO names in the industry to get their insights, add our own insights, and round it all up into a cohesive content piece that covers the topic authoritatively.Here’s an outreach template you can use to get expert insights for your content.Guest bloggingThe good ol’ guest blogging isn’t out of style.It’s essentially a content collaboration technique wherein you create content (such as a blog post or infographic) for other relevant publications in your niche. The goal is to build contextual backlinks to your content and landing pages and reach new, relevant audiences.Here are the high-level steps involved:Find relevant websites with a good domain authorityGo through their blog to understand what kind of content they publishRead their guest blogging guidelines (if any) and reach out to them with a personalized email pitchShare topic ideas that benefit their audienceUpon approval of a topic, create content as per their editorial guidelinesSend it for review and await publicationIt’s a win-win activity as the publisher gets free, fresh content, while you get greater brand visibility to a broad audience and quality backlinks that help your SEO. The same blogger outreach tools can be useful to find the right guest post opportunities in your niche.Here’s a sample guest post outreach pitch our content marketing team uses.PRGetting your SaaS featured on top media outlets and business magazines like Forbes can tremendously boost your brand awareness and credibility.Digital PR starts with building relationships with high-profile journalists and editors. Engage with them on social media, comment on their recent content, share useful information that may help them, and initiate a friendly conversation before making an ask.Once they get to know you and your business, here’s how to improve your odds of getting media coverage:Tie your content to a current event. Set upGoogle Alertsfor topics and people in your niche to pitch a timely story.Share a unique angle, such as new data from original research or a hot take. Make your angle immediately visible in the outreach email subject line and body.A journalist’s inbox is as full as a centipede’s sock drawer. So, make your pitch as easy and concise as possible, sharing all content assets upfront. Personalize the subject line.Email marketingAre you building an email list to capture leads?If not, consider starting now. Because email is a powerful channel to have more personalized interactions with your prospects and nurture them into customers.Incentivize website visitors to sign up for your email list by offering a lead magnet, such as a white paper, checklist, cheatsheet, template, or even a short free trial of your SaaS product.In this way, a prospect gets free value from your brand and you get their email address that you can use to foster a relationship with them and stay top of mind.For instance,Hootsuite offers a free templateas a lead magnet.You’ll find such email sign-up invites and lead magnet pop-ups as you browse their blog.Once you click on the CTA, they ask for your business email address and some other basic information before sending you the content promised.This works great to build their email marketing list and fuel lead generation, and many SaaS brands use this strategy.Once you have an email marketing list, promoting your latest content — whether it’s published on your own blog or a contributed piece to a reputed website — to your list is a great way to drive more initial traffic and engagement to your piece (which also gives it an SEO boost!).Social mediaAn obvious channel to distribute your content, here are a few tips to keep in mind for content promotion on social media:Pick the right platforms. As you know, for SaaS, Twitter and LinkedIn tend to be more effective than Instagram and Facebook not just for hiring but connecting with audiences. Still, do your research depending on your niche and experiment with the platforms that show promise.Promote your content not just with your company’s social handles but use your following as a founder to drive more traffic to the piece. Encourage your team to do the same.Use a social media management tool likeHootsuiteorBufferto schedule your posts and get deeper analytics about what content performs best and what are the best times to post. Monitor comments and mentions, and respond to each of them in a timely manner.Research which hashtags are relevant to your niche and use them judiciously.Don’t just copy and paste the headline of your blog post for your social post. Repurpose your content and tailor it to each platform, retaining the overall pain point gist of the article and your brand voice. End your post with a call to action that invites them to read the piece on your website.Here’s a great example of content promotion on Twitter from Ahrefs.Content maps can help you keep your content aligned with your business. Here are two tried and tested ways of doing it—template included!—with Mateusz Makosiewicz (@m_makosiewicz).https://t.co/k3hElIIWho— Ahrefs (@ahrefs)April 28, 2022Note how they’ve managed to neatly convey the gist of the piece and the benefits of clicking-through (“template included”) within the 280-character limit. They’ve also tagged the author to try and expand the reach of the tweet.However, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get your audience’s attention on social media, especially as a business.If you can cough up an additional budget for content promotion, then you have the ability to target your exact audience on search and social, and get your content seen by the right eyeballs…2. Paid promotionWe’ll be honest — we aren’t experts in running paid ads. Organic SaaS marketing is our forte.And so, in this section, we’ll share some handpicked examples of paid content distribution done right, along with links to guides for further reading and implementation.Paid social mediaWhile most brands (such as Bridgecrew below) prefer promoting product pages or free trial/demo landing pages with paid social media ads, you can also promote your best content assets with PPC ads.That’s because the bulk of your target audience hasn’t yet heard of your SaaS.So it’s a good idea to target these ToFu prospects with valuable content (guides, checklists, videos, etc.) instead of hard selling.If they click through and enjoy your content, they will be inclined to try your SaaS over your competitors.Feel free to go throughthis guideon how to use paid social ads for SaaS.Paid searchPay-per-click advertising on Google is particularly well suited for SaaS businesses, as the majority of SaaS prospects start (with an educational intent) and end (with a purchase intent) their product research on Google (not social media or Amazon).You’ve likely seen paid ads showing up on the top of Google for branded (e.g. “Mailchimp”) as well as non-branded (e.g. “HR software tools”) search terms.In this way, smart SaaS brands (with a budget) useGoogle Adsto occupy the top spots not just for branded and commercial keywords (e.g. “buy HR software”) but also for content keywords across the funnel.For example, bidding for keywords such as “[Competitor] alternatives”, “Best [Industry] Software”, etc. — your BoFu content that’s designed to convert decision-makers — can be a highly effective PPC content promotion strategy.Check outthis guide on SaaS PPCto dive deeper into paid advertising with Google Ads.Display adsDo you see the Freshdesk ad at the bottom right corner of the screenshot below? That’s a display advertisement.Also known as banner ads, you’ll often find SaaS brands promoting their product or content assets on third-party websites using a video, image/illustration, along with a short copy.These are usually created and published using the Google Display Network (GDN) and are ideal for retargeting prospects who’ve already engaged with your website (visited a page, read an article, etc.) in the recent past.Also, as with paid social media ads, display ads can work great to build credibility with new prospects by promoting your best content assets (such as a super in-depth guide or white paper).Go through thisgreat guidefrom HubSpot on using GDN to run remarketing and prospecting display ads for your SaaS.3. Develop a link building outreach strategyYour content distribution is incomplete without a proper link building strategy in place.Besides guest blogging and blogger outreach, you need to have more (non-paid) ways to build quality links to your on-site content assets and landing pages consistently with strategic outreach. A powerful outreach strategy doesn’t rely solely on just one or two methods of organic content distribution.Successful link building outreach is largely about building win-win relationships with niche publishers, which takes time but is very rewarding.Here are a few more tactics from ourcomprehensive article on link building for SaaS— which includes guest blogging, influencer outreach, and PR techniques; discussed above — that you can consider including in your SaaS link building strategy:We recommend you go throughthe articleto dive deeper into these tactics and pick the right ones for your link building outreach strategy.PS:You can get a head start in building high-quality links by taking advantage of the editorial relations we’ve built with hundreds of SaaS and B2B publications over the years.Check out our SaaS link building services orget in touch with usto learn more.4. Develop a content relaunch strategy“The Content Relaunch” strategy, as coined by Brian Dean of Backlinko, helped him achieve an impressive260.7%organic search engine traffic growth within just two weeks.It also helped him gain a ton of new backlinks for the piece he relaunched, which boosted the page’s rankings.And so, this is one low-hanging fruit strategy that definitely deserves your attention. It helps you make the most of your existing content by making it better and giving it a fresh opportunity to get noticed by new audiences.Here are the three simple steps of this strategy:Step #1:Identify under-performing contentStep #2:Improve and revamp that contentStep #3:Republish itYour underperforming pieces are ones that:Rank on the second page or lower of Google, or are dropping their positionsAre witnessing a consistent drop in organic trafficAren’t driving satisfactory engagement or conversionsLook into your Google Analytics and Search Console to pinpoint your underperforming content. You can also try theAnimalz Revive toolto get a list of articles that should be refreshed and relaunched.Image source via unknownThen, to improve your content, you can:Update old images and examples with fresh onesRestructure your post for readabilityAdd more social proof in the form of the latest research and case studiesAddress common reader questions and add bonus tipsFinally, relaunch your content with full force:Let your blogger outreach and publishers’ network know about the revised pieceChange the publication date in the CMSShare the post on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.Send your piece to your email listDive deeper into each of these stepshere.Now, your team is consistent in producing and promoting your content. But how do you know if you’re hitting the mark and are heading in the right direction? That’s what the next chapter is about…Chapter 8:Analysis and ReportingIn chapter 2, we talked about setting SMART goals and defining some key metrics to help evaluate the success of your content marketing activities, iterate on successes, and minimize wasted efforts.Emphasis on iteration — as your audience, just like Google’s algorithm, keeps evolving — so you need your strategy and its execution to stay relevant and in tune with what your audience engages with the most.But for that, you need to first know what your team must analyze and report on at the content level…1. What should you measure?You have your goals and broad KPIs in front of you.It’s time to get specific. Here are some sample metrics you can consider measuring for different types of content marketing goals. Again, note that each business is different and thus, you and your team need to determine which metrics are worth your time (don’t measure everything!).Brand awarenessHow well your content is helping attract the attention of prospects. This can be measured by the following metrics:New website visitors (organic and referral)Pageviews and unique pageviewsOrganic page rankings and impressionsSocial media reach and sharesInbound links and brand mentionsBranded search volumeYou can find all these metrics in your Google Analytics and Search Console. To analyze inbound backlinks and monitor brand mentions,Ahrefs Alertsworks perfectly.EngagementHow many people are interacting with your brand via onsite content, social media posts, etc. This can be measured with metrics such as:On-site blog: Comments, shares, internal link clicksSocial media: Reactions (like, support, etc.), shares, comments, retweets, link clicks, DMsAverage time on pagePages per sessionBounce rateYou can find the last three metrics in your Google Analytics.Lead generationThese metrics show well your content is doing at capturing visitors’ information, such as their email addresses that could be used for future marketing campaigns.Lead magnet downloadsEmail newsletter opt-insContact form fillsTwitter/LinkedIn followsTo analyze social media metrics, the platforms themselves have built-in analytics your team can use, but here’s agreat list of top free and paid social media analytics toolsyou can invest in for advanced analysis and reporting.Conversions and salesFor SaaS businesses, conversion metrics typically include:Free trial or free plan sign-upsDemo requestsSales calls scheduledAnd sales would mean just that: free trial users becoming paying customers at the end of the trial or upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan.To correctly measure lead generation, conversions, and sales metrics for your content pages, you need topick the right attribution model in your Google Analyticsandset up Goals in Google Analytics.Customer retention/loyaltyThese metrics help you measure your overall content strategy’s beyond the funnel performance, and how well your content efforts are helping in not just converting visitors but retaining them as loyal customers.Use a subscription analytics tool likeBaremetricsorChartMogulto see how your SaaS is performing in terms of these metrics while tracking your BoFu and beyond the funnel content performance, as these metrics are closely linked to your end of the funnel content efforts.2. Measure Your Content Marketing ROIOnce you know which metrics to measure at the content level and are doing so with the right tools, you might wanna address the elephant in the room — what is the return on investment of all your content efforts?Well, since content powers your entire inbound strategy, its ROI impact can be measured in several ways, including the KPIs you defined earlier.We have anepic guide on measuring content marketing ROIfrom one of our content leads.Go give it a read to learn how to determine your SaaS content marketing ROI by using some formulas and KPIs, along with additional tips, useful resources, and case studies.Chapter 9:Iteration, Maintenance, and GrowthYour team is working like clockwork to create and promote content as per a defined content plan. You also know how well your content pieces are doing in terms of driving conversions.But that’s not the end of the story.In this chapter, let’s talk about how you can scale your content marketing efforts and build upon your content foundations for continually bigger and better ROI.1. Content repurposingMake the most of what you have — that’s essentially what the content repurposing tactic is all about.Say, is your team largely producing blog posts to go on your SaaS website?Then why not leverage all the research and planning that went into creating those posts by presenting (and refining) the same information into new formats such as:Pinterest infographicsYouTube short explainer videos or vlogsSpotify podcastsSlideShare presentationsTwitter threadsThe idea is to extract every ounce of value from your best-performing pieces and reach new audiences — such as people who might prefer watching a video over reading a blog post — while also giving Google more content to crawl and index (assuming you publish the fresh format on your website too!).So, as we mentioned in ourarticle on SaaS website content strategy, you can turn stats-based blog posts into beautiful infographics for better shareability and linkability, or even re-package articles on a specific subject into a gated, downloadable eBook that can fuel lead generation.But the biggest benefit of repurposing content is that it makes it easier to double down on your wins. You don’t need to write every article, shoot every video, or design every infographic from scratch. Scale your efforts with what’s already working well for you.2. Creating and maintaining evergreen contentWe’re fine beating the same drum again — evergreen content >>> trendy content.The best content marketing and SEO campaigns are ones that drive a snowball effect.And for that to happen, your best content pieces need to stay relevant as the years go by.But how do they stay relevant? With periodic content updates, of course.Somewhat similar to the content relaunch strategy, maintaining evergreen content involves:Identifying evergreen pieces (such as how-to articles on a topic)Revisiting them periodically (say, every quarter)Ensuring all information, tactics, data, research, etc. that’s shared is up-to-date, and adding new information (examples, images, tips, statistics, etc.) that further solidifies the existing contentHitting the ‘Publish’ button againFurthermore, if your evergreen content is kept up-to-date and still valuable, there’s no reason not to keep promoting it periodically.Have your social team line up your ever-relevant content pieces on your social accounts.And if you’re publishing fresh content that’s related to an evergreen piece you already have on your blog, promote them together around the same time — before and during the new content launch — and you’ve got yourself a nice little topical campaign.In fact, your evergreen content pieces are also perfect for repurposing into new formats over time.3. Social listening for growthIt’s simple: content that aligns well with your audience’s tastes and interests is content that performs best.Yes, you have defined the characteristics of your target audience, the questions they’re asking, and the topics they look up on search engines and social media.But there’s another way to get insights into what your audience wants and expects from brands like yours (Oh, and they may not always take the time to tell you directly or respond to your surveys.).That method is known as social listening — the process of identifying and analyzing what is being said about your company, its product, and the industry as a whole on the internet.Social listening helps you understand how your prospects and customers view your SaaS even when they aren’t explicitly tagging your business.Besides that, social listening can help your business growth because:People like it when brands respond as they feel heard. Social listening enables you to stay on top of any brand mentions and hop in on the conversation promptly.It lets you stay on top of your online reputation and control the narrative around your brand. You can personally respond to any negative comments or complaints right away, offer a quick resolution, and turn negative sentiments into positive reviews.You can uncover new opportunities. If you find people complaining about the same problem, rooting for the same feature, or pivoting to a specific competitor, it gives you clear direction about what you need to do next.You can discover the kinds of content that those who follow and mention you enjoy by seeing their likes, shares, hashtags, and follows. Then, you can tailor your content strategy to align with their tastes, become more relevant, and draw them into your brand.It encourages a customer-centric mindset in your firm.Pick asocial listening tool. Keep monitoring what your audience says about your business, its rivals, and the industry. Accordingly, keep iterating your content strategy to match their needs.4. Scaling your content marketing cycleAfter a few months of consistent efforts, your team can gauge fairly well what’s working for SEO, what’s driving engagement from your audience, and the ROI on your content.But let’s be clear — scaling up your content marketing doesn’t mean you have to go from 10 high-quality blog posts per month to 20 so-so ones.It means:You have the content performance data you need to hire additional writers, designers, and strategists (freelance or in-house).You can experiment with new content types and formats.You can optimize your content creation and distribution processes by adopting new tools and tactics.You can target new audience segments and promote on more social platforms as your SaaS offerings expand.You can decide which pieces in your content repository can be repurposed, refurbished, and relaunched.Even if you decide to maintain the same content creation and promotion pace, keep a close eye on your SEO rivals so you can tell when the competition heats up, which may mean your content efforts have to be kicked up a notch as well.Chapter 10:SaaS Content Marketing ToolsTo plan and execute any successful online marketing campaign, you need two things: a good team and a good toolkit.By now, you already know most of the must-have content marketing tools as you flipped through the chapters.

Conversely, if you have a good product, then your SaaS can’t reach its true heights without compelling content pouring under your brand name that doesn’t feel like marketing.So, if content isn’t your strength or if you lack the resources to do it all in-house, then considerjoining forces with an experienced SEO content agency that specializes in content marketing for SaaS— capable of taking care of everything from strategy to distribution.We hope you find this guide helpful!B2BB2CContent MarketingData DrivenMarketingProduct MarketingSaaSSEOAuthorPratik DholakiyaPratik Dholakiya is the Founder of Growfusely, a SaaS content marketing agency specializing in content and data-driven SEO.ContributorsCheck out these useful resources for your SaaSContent MarketingB2B SaaS Landing Pages Guide for Success – 5 Landing Pages AnalyzedPratik DholakiyaBlogTop of the Funnel for SaaS: Definition, Content Types, Best Practices, and MistakesVikrant JhalaSubscribe to The SaaS Marketing InsiderI acknowledge I'll only receive value-packed emails from Growfusely.

In a crowded marketplace, SaaS companies can stand out by educating potential customers about their pain points and over time, provide solutions to those pain points. When done effectively, content marketing can guide your leads to the notion that the best solution to their problem is your company.Still, it can bechallengingto curate content that is both engaging and fulfills your audience’s needs. How you format, repurpose or enrich your content can have a significant impact on your content’s success, and these brands take unique approaches to doing so. When you’re looking for examples to inspire and reinvigorate yourcontent strategymoving forward, these organizations stand out among the rest.1. HubspotIt shouldn’t be a shock to anyone that HubSpot leads the pack when it comes to SaaScontent marketing. Their site generates millions of unique visitors each month, in large part due to their focus on curating high-quality content across multiple channels.HubSpot’s reach as a business enables them to take the same comprehensive approach to their content.Their blogfeatures educational material that spans subjects in marketing, sales and service, which carries over to their premium content and email campaigns as well.Given their diversity of services, HubSpot has a vast potential audience. By segmenting their blog into these areas, they’re able to better serve these audiences and align content with their needs. A developer can learn more about user experience, while a customer service manager can read about how to best support their clients, and there’s no irrelevant content clogging their feed.In short, the segmentation of HubSpot’s blog makes it simple for new visitors to find relevant,top-of-funnel content. By aligning those segments with their core product offerings, HubSpot has a clear path by which to nurture leads generated from different blogs down the funnel with similar content.2. Neil PatelNeil Patel’s blog is a testament to leading with education in content marketing. Throughout all of his content, Patel consistently leads with the why of a problem or topic, focusing on educating his readers. Despite the technical aspect of Patel’s subject matter, he places a great deal of emphasis on making his content human and approachable. By the end of a blog post, a reader can feel comfortable going off and doing that task by themselves.As an individual who supports the search efforts of a wide array of businesses and industries, Patel has access to a vast amount of data. His content marketing is subsequently informed by this data and guarantees to the reader that the content they’re reading is tried and tested.3. VidyardUtilizing videoin content marketing is second nature to Vidyard. As a video platform, Vidyard manages to weave their product into their content marketing on a regular basis, making it easy to speak to its benefits by the time a visitor reaches sales.While Vidyard’s content library is not as expansive as some of its counterparts on this list, they place an emphasis on deep-dive topics and long-form content. Consider their post aboutpersonalized video, a tool offered by the Vidyard platform.The estimated 11-minute read provides a deep-dive look at using personalized video including what it is, how to make a personalized video and case studies of brands who have used it. The post is well-segmented, with a table of contents and anchor links enabling readers to jump to parts of the post as they need to, making it equally accessible for returning readers.Given the technical nature of the subject matter, Vidyard breaks up the content with example videos and quick explainers that allow readers to consume the information in their preferred format while also providing visual diversity.Finally, the included videos frequently feature Vidyard’s vice president of marketing, Tyler Lessard. By turning Tyler into a spokesperson and face of thebrand, they build personal relationships between viewers and their team. These connections can be leveraged down-the-line when a prospect reaches sales by bringing in Tyler’s familiar face.4. MozA list of excellent SaaS content marketers wouldn’t be complete without Moz. As far as subject matter goes, search andSEO can be among the most technical. Moz produces regular content without overwhelming their readers.Their blog is thoughtfully organized by categories like branding, optimization, and SEO across different sectors. This enables readers to explore based on their own pain points and not feel quickly overwhelmed by the density of content.Moz takes it a step further with theirWhiteboard Fridaytradition. Typically accompanying long-form blog posts, Whiteboard Fridays are videos produced by Moz that explore more complicated topics with a presenter sketching out points and diagrams on a whiteboard. Makes sense, right?These videos enable readers to take a topic at their own pace. While the videos typically cover everything included in a post, the alternate medium can make it easier for some readers to digest. That said, given that the video lives at the top of the post, readers can explore individual topics on their own by scrolling on past the video.Like Vidyard’s videos, Whiteboard Fridays also aid in building the brands of its hosts. By featuring real faces from Moz, their content marketing is building up the Moz brand just as much as their people’s, which can help down the line in sales conversations.5. DriftLike others on this list, Drift’s content strategy aligns perfectly with their product —a conversational marketing tool.Weaving their product throughout their content marketing strategy means that you’ll only find one form on Drift’s website (to sign up as a user). Instead, they made themselves their best case study by driving conversions through their chatbot.Drift’s chatbot is deeply customized to align with their content and their audience. After a user has visited their site a number of times, the chatbot is triggered to offer them more content, directing them to a robust resource library.As leads move further down the funnel and the content they interact with becomes more specific, so too does the chatbot. Based on the user’s behavior, differentchatbot playbooksare triggered and direct users to premium content, additional resources or a conversation with sales. Along the way, interactions with the chatbot inform Drift about their user’s behaviors, pain points or content needs which helps inform their future content strategy.Not only do these interactions with the chatbot bolster Drift’s case as a thought-leader, but by having their product itself play a significant role in their content strategy and guiding leads through the funnel, users begin to see Drift as a solution very early in theirbuyer’s journey.6. ZendeskZendesk is in the business of creating abetter customer serviceexperience for their clients and it’s reflected in their content. While most SaaS content marketing is intent on guiding readers toward an eventual solution —  the software — Zendesk recognized that there’s more to managing customer relationships than just the tool itself.Zendesk’s online magazine and annual event,Relate, focuses on the human aspect of customer service. Unlike their separate blog that covers various aspects of customer relationships and how software can support them, Relate addresses self-care, work-life balance and other deeply personal, relatable topics.Emulating online magazines, Zendesk offers Relate content through a number of different mediums including standard posts, videos, podcasts and online events. The variety of content offers maintain an air of approachability and improve their reach.Ultimately, humans are at the heart of customer relationships. By positioning themselves as a thought-leader in more than just the solution they provide, Zendesk leverages their content marketing to build brand awareness and equity. Visitors who discover Zendesk through a post on Relate about practicing empathy in the workplace may become promoters of the brand to decision-makers at their business.7. UnbounceUnbounce software enables marketers to build conversion-optimized landing pages, so their product features heavily in their content marketing. As a thought-leader with over a decade in the industry, Unbounce has a robust blog that hones in on conversion optimization andlanding page best practices.With that in mind, it can be a challenge to find ways to repurpose or find new channels for your content to improve its reach. Unbounce addressed this challenge by creating avideo crash coursein landing page optimization for the online education websiteSkillshare.By taking their expertise to a new platform, Unbounce extends the reach of their content while also creating assets that can live on their own site, improving its return on investment. It can be challenging to illustrate pain points and solutions in first-touch content, but visitors discovering Unbounce on Skillshare get a taste of landing page best practices, all executed via the Unbounce platform.In this way, Unbounce extends the reach of their brand and puts their product front and center. As an added bonus, Skillshare is an Unbounce client, which helps prove their value and expertise to Skillshare users.TakeawayAcross the brands featured on this list, there are a handful of themes to keep in mind. Strong content marketing leads with education and aligns with your solution while focusing on making the subject matter approachable and engaging to the reader.By showcasing that your company knows what it’s talking about, you build trust and credibility as you work to turn your visitors into leads and eventually, customers. As you develop your own content marketing strategy, be sure to think about how you can take advantage of your expertise and present content in new and engaging ways.This post has been updated and was originally published in October 2014.Tag(s):MarketingDemand GenerationChris SinglemannChris is a Brand Marketer at New Breed where he is responsible for crafting design and video assets that support our brand.

Learn how to create a SaaS content marketing strategy to stand out from your competitors.Post byOmid G|January 12, 2023I grew a SaaS company’s SEO traffic from 25k visitors/month to 500k visitors/month from content marketing. That’s a 1,900% increase. I’m going to lay out exactly how I did it in this post so you don’t have to go through years of struggling to figure it out like I did.This will be one of those articles that you read and refer to often. We are about to go over what content to create, how to create it, how to think about distribution, how to track ROI, how to find outsourced writers, and more.I decided to dump years of knowledge into this mega article because it's something I wish my younger self had to reference.There’s a lot ofcontent around the webon what content marketing for SaaS companies is and how to do it. But the issue is that many of these videos and blog posts are quite vague, and try to create a one-size fits all solution.The thing is, there’s a lot of nuance.It’s not an answer most content marketers, or business owners, want to hear. But, there are frameworks you can follow to help guide you to create a content marketing strategy specific to yourSaaS website.‍This article gives you those frameworks.‍I’ve worked as a content marketer in the SaaS space for the past seven years, and it wasn’t until the last three years where I really started to figure out what I was doing. That means for four years, I just kept trying and testing to see what worked.In the first four years, I got good at writing informational content, case studies, white papers, landing pages, and all that. But the thing is content marketers are not supposed to be writers. We’re contentmarketersnot contentwriters.In my previous roles as a content marketing manager, I was creating most of the content myself. But content marketing is about being a marketer and putting on your growth hat. How do you actually create content that you know people willfindandresonatewith?And not only that, how will you turn website traffic from these visitors into paying customers?Because let’s face it, business owners really decide to invest in content marketing because they believe it will increase their revenue. If a company is not generating revenue from content marketing, they will look elsewhere to invest their time and resources.What is SaaS content marketing?Content marketing is a powerfulmarketing strategy SaaS businessescan use to attract and find their target customers. When done correctly,B2B SaaS companiescan organically attract the right customers without needing to spend money on advertising.The content marketing channels you use for a SaaS (software-as-a-service) company will rely on your business. However, the best place to start is with your website. In this article, I’ll show you how to think about what type of content to post on your website. From there, you can then dive into other means of distributing the content on your website through SEO (search engine optimization), ads, sponsorships, email marketing, and social media.Okay, enough of me rambling. Let’s get into crafting your content marketing strategy for your SaaS company.Get your pen and notepad ready. I dumped a large portion of my knowledge into this article.11 steps to creating your SaaS content marketing strategyHere are the steps you should follow when crafting your content marketing strategy:Defining your business goalsGathering customer intelCreating a content lifecycle strategyTypes of content to createDoing keyword research (the right way)Setting up your website for successConversionsDistributing your contentCreating a system around OKRsROI and trackingScaling your content teamOkay, let’s dive a bit deeper into each one.1. Defining your business goalsThe first step of any content marketing strategy is to define your businesses goals, then set OKRs around those goals.At the end of the day, your business goal is probably tied heavily to revenue. You need paying subscribers to fuel your business.‍For the remainder of this article, I’m going to use a hypothetical SaaS company to give you an example of how I would craft the content strategy. Let’s call our company ReachThem — a SaaS product that lets you send cold outreach emails.‍The ReachThem founding team has a goal of hitting $10M in ARR (annual recurring revenue). They know content is important and hire a content marketing manager to help them create a content marketing operation.I’m going to assume this is all we know. Goal setting is nuanced and it’s going to come from a skilled leader that can help.What we do know is revenue is the goal. So when we move on to creating our content marketing strategy and OKRs, we need to keep this in mind.‍When crafting your content marketing strategy from complete scratch, you always want to start at the bottom of the funnel and make your way up to the top.This is why we first start with business goals and revenue — they affect the bottomline of a business.But, before we can start creating content, we need to understand who we are creating for.2. Gathering customer intelGathering customer intel basically means creating buyer personas to understand your target audience. If you already have data on existing customers, or a product marketing manager to help, then this part should be fairly simple.If possible, ask someone on your team to help you look into yourhighest LTV(lifetime value) users and study who these people are. Chances are, your SaaS product resonates the most with these people as theycontinue to pay for a subscription.If you have a product marketing manager on your team, you can also set up a meeting with them to figure out who your target customers are and what their pain points are.If you don’t have access to LTV data or a product marketer,your next best bet is to get in contact with your customer support team. Study customer support tickets coming in and set up meetings with customers to better understand what problems they are encountering.After gathering all of this information, you’ll want to create customer profiles. In the our example of the cold outreach tool, ReachThem, we can think about it like this:What is their role:Founder at a marketing agencyWhat industry are they in:MarketingWhere do they find content to learn from:Google, YouTube, Twitter, Webinars, online communitiesWhy would they use a cold outreach tool:To send outbound emails to potential clientsNow that you have this information, you can give the profile a name to easily remember it. In the case above, we can call this person Melanie. Melanie, the marketing agency founder.However, you may find that you have many different profiles. For example, you could also have:What is their role:Affiliate manager at a skincare companyWhat industry are they in:SkincareWhere do they find content to learn from:Google, YouTube, Twitter, newsletters, online communitiesWhy would they use a cold outreach tool:To send emails to invite beauty influencers to join their affiliate programIn this case, we have a completely different person with a (somewhat) different use case. We can call this person Alex.Okay, let’s do one more.What is their role:Recruiting manager at an engineering recruiting firmWhat industry are they in:Engineering, recruitingWhere do they find content to learn from:LinkedIn, GoogleWhy would they use a cold outreach tool:To find engineering candidates for tech companiesIn this other case, we have Rachel the recruiter who needs a tool to find potential candidates for her clients.So now we have three different profiles — Melanie, Alex, and Rachel — all who need a cold outreach tool, but for different reasons.Write down all of your customer profiles, remember to look at any existing data if you get stuck, and put these somewhere you can refer to often.I like to create sticky notes and place them on the corner of my computer monitor so I can always remember who I need to be creating content for. Yes, I’m a little weird like that.3. Creating a content lifecycle strategyNow that we know our business goals, and our target audience profiles, we can get into the good stuff. This is where we’ll map out all the content we need to produce.When it comes to B2B SaaS content marketing, we want to make sure our website really speaks to our profiles and converts well. We need to lay the foundations so any time we drive (qualified) traffic to our website, we know we have a good chance of getting a conversion.You can think of content as going through a customer journey, or stages of a content lifecycle.Stages of content marketingThe “who I am and what I do”This is the phase of your company that basically tells everyone what your product is and what it does. This is your homepage, product/feature pages, and company updates on your blog.Rampdoes a great job with their homepage and product feature pages.The “how to use me”This is the educational phase where you show people how to use your product. This is your “resource center.” This can be in the form of a different part of your site, like how Semrush hasSemrush Academy. Or, like how Webflow hasWebflow University.This is the content you need to activate your new users and make sure they keep paying for a subscription.Semrush offers a lot of free courses.The “why you should use me”This is the scaling phase where you focus on growth and finding your target customers. This is where you go after non-branded keywords on your blog, use case pages, and your competitors. This can be in the form of inspirational list posts, “how to” posts (not directly related to your product), vs pages, and customer highlights/case studies.HelloSign has some greatuse case pages.Zapier hasa great blogwith a wide blend of different articles.The content lifecycle diagramNext, you want to create a diagram that shows the content lifecycle that you intend to cover. Here is an example of one I made and used to help a SaaS company scale pretty quickly:A content lifecycle diagram for our fake company, ReachThem.You might want to zoom in.You’ll want to create content from right to left (with exception of Referral and possibly Retention sections).I know, the diagram looks like it should be read from left to right, but you need to first start at the bottom of the funnel (Retention + Activation). That way when you do create top of the funnel (Awareness) content, you’ll give website visitors a chance to find content that makes them convert (more on that later).One misconception I personally had early on was that if someone landed on an inspirational blog post in the Awareness stage, they would then browse through the rest of my website and find the lower funnel content.This does happen, but not often.When it comes to SaaS, especially in B2B, most people use Google to find content, not your website. So you need to make sure that all of your content on your website is SEO optimized.This way, when someone Googles an inspiration piece of content, they can discover you. When someone Googles a piece of content towards the middle or lower part of the funnel, they can also find you.Assume people will be using Google to find your content, but create content foreach stage of the funnelso there’s always a link people can click on in Google search.If you need some more clarity on the type of content to create for each stage, SEO for the Rest of Us hasa great guideon search intent that looks like this:Okay, now that we have a general framework for the stages of awareness to create content for, let’s figure out what types of pages to create on our site.4. Types of content to createWhen creating content, remember that we want to start at the lowest part of the funnel, then move up from there — did I say that already?Here are four types of content to create:Use case pagesOne of the first things you should create on your website, after your standard product feature pages, is a use case section. These pages essentially tell visitorswhatyour product is for andwhoit’s for.Here is how ClickUp, a project management tool, does it:In the case of our fake company, ReachThem, we can create use case pages with URLs that look like this:Recruitment (https://www.reachthem.com/for/recruitment-outreach)Client outreach (https://www.reachthem.com/for/client-outreach)Influencer outreach (https://www.reachthem.com/for/influencer-outreach)We want to have URLs like this because it’s good SEO practice. Some companies go as far as having URLs for each use case page look like this:Recruitment (https://www.reachthem.com/recruitment-outreach-tool)Client outreach (https://www.reachthem.com/client-outreach-tool)Influencer outreach (https://www.reachthem.com/influencer-outreach-tool)Rather than being in our subfolder called “for,” which we use for use case to claim that “ReachThem is for X,” we can also put them on our root domain and try to rank for terms like “recruitment outreach tool,” “client outreach tool,” and “influencer outreach tool.”The way you structure your URLs will depend on the CMS you use (Irecommend Webflowfor SaaS companies) and how you want your user experience to be. If you have all of your use case pages in a subfolder, like /for/, you can then create a central landing page on:https://www.reachthem.com/forThat will give you an opportunity show all of your use cases and link out to each individual page.This is generally a better approach for user experience. I won’t go too deep in this article on how to structure these pages for SEO, but I did write a guide onhow to write SEO blog postsif you want to check out!Regardless, map out all of your use case pages you need to create and get those on your site first.VS pagesThe next part of our content creation journey is to create content for those that are almost ready to purchase. Remember, bottom of the funnel content first.Chances are, there are many other tools like yours already available — call them, your competitors.An easy SEO tactic is to create “vs” or “alternative” pages.There are a lot of outreach tools on the market, in fact I included a handful ofmy favorite here.So let’s make sure that when someone is trying to make a purchasing decision, and comparing us to our competitors, we have the opportunity to speak to those people.For our example, ReachThem, some popular competitors can include Mailshake, Outreach, and Lemlist.So we’ll want to start creating VS pages, similar to our use case pages, to target these competitors.It can look something like this:ReachThem vs Mailshake(https://www.reachthem.com/vs/mailshake)ReachThem vs Outreach(https://www.reachthem.com/vs/outreach)ReachThem vs Lemlist(https://www.reachthem.com/vs/lemlist)Now, whenever someone searches for “ReachThem vs X,” or “X vs ReachThem,” we can show up in the top results and give us an opportunity to persuade a potential customer to use us instead of a competitor.Later, we can even create blog posts that target keywords like “[your competitor] alternatives.” That would look something like:https://www.reachthem.com/blog/mailshake-alternativesAnd then, we could link out to our VS pages from that blog post. But more on blog posts in a sec.Similar to our use case pages, it’s good to have these in a subfolder like /vs/ so that we can create a central landing page on:https://www.reachthem.com/vsThis can then link out to all of our competitor VS pages.This subfolder structure will also allow us to easily duplicate page templates to add new competitors as they come up.Here are a few real examples in the wild:Webflow’s “Webflow vs WordPress”pageHubSpot’s “HubSpot vs Salesforce”pageAsana’s “Asana vs Trello”pageYou’ll notice the last two examples have URLs like /comparisons/ and /compare/. While these are okay, people don’t really search things like this. When people search for comparisons between two or more companies they use the word “vs.” Which is why it’s probably best to be more literal for SEO and place these VS pages in a subfolder like /vs/.One thing to note as well, these VS pages may not get a ton of traffic like blog posts would, but they convert really well. Remember the “levels of awareness” diagram above? The lower down the funnel we go, the lower the traffic but the higher the conversion rates.This is because the intent behind searching for terms like “your company vs a competitor” means that the person is ready to make a purchasing decision. But of course, someone has to know you exist in the first place which is why the traffic will be lower.Blog postsNext up are blog posts, my favorite. When I said I took a SaaS company from 25k unique visitors a month to 250K visitors/month from SEO, the majority of the traffic came from blog posts.This part will have a lot of nuance, as each company will be different.What a lot of SaaS companies do is post product updates and things related to their company on their blog. While these are important and nice to have, they won’t drive a lot of unique visitors to your website.If we only talk about our company, the only people that will read our blog posts are those that already know we exist. We wantnewpeople to know we exist.Plus, let’s be honest, when’s the last time you browsed through a company blog to read product updates? I’m not hating, but this is where our growth mindset has to come to play.Blogging is still very much alive in 2023, but it’s not how it was in 2006.Back then, people read blogs because they loved a particular blog and binged through the content. And that’s maybe true for some blogs today, but not most.Today, most people land on a blog post from a company because they are Googling a subject that the blog has written about. Most people today land on individual blog posts — be it from Google SEO or social media.So with that in mind, let’s cast our net as far as we can. Let’s create a full-blown media arm on our website.You’re going to need some keyword research skills here to identify topics to go after. Your ability to rank high for a particular keyword will rely heavily on your domain authority, if you’ve covered related topics before, and how well you are able to explain the topic.On top of that, you’ll want to use acontent optimization platformlike Clearscope or Surfer SEO to make sure that all of yourcontent outlinesare keyword rich and SEO optimized.I’ll explain more in the keyword research section. See you in a bit.Social media time!Related reads:10 best Clearscope alternatives for creating SEO contentSocial media postsAnother great content marketing strategy is to post on social media. I’m not going to lie, I’m more of an SEO over social media type of guy when it comes to SaaS. But I have seen the power of social media firsthand.Social media is a great way to build a community around your brand. The key to a successful social media strategy is to truly understand the algorithm of the platform you are creating for. I’m going to discuss this in greater detail in the Distribution section of this article.For now, I’m just going to say the do’s and don’ts:Do:Repurpose your existing content on social media in a useful and entertaining way that plays to the platforms algorithmDon’t:Just share blog posts and company updates on social media. People on social media don’t care about that stuff.Do:Create content just for the sake of entertainment. Valuable information, memes, educational videos — these do well.Don’t:Promote yourself directlyDo:Create content specific to the format for each social media platformDon’t:Post the exact same thing on every social media platformAs mentioned, I’ll explain more later in this article. If you want some inspiration on some companies that do social media marketing right, check out Webflow (Twitter), Refine Labs (LinkedIn), and Slidebean (YouTube).5. Doing keyword research (the right way)Keyword research is at the core of your content marketing strategy, especially if you’re focused on organic search.My favorite keyword research tool to use isAhrefs, but there are many great one out there as well.Semrushis a close competitor to Ahrefs, and you can use a tool likeKeysearch(affiliate link) if you’re on a tight budget. I personally started my SEO journey using Keysearch and still use it today.I like to have at least two different keyword research tools to compare the data and make better decisions — Ahrefs as my primary discovery tool and Keysearch to double check search volume and difficulty.Ahrefs is great because it will show you a wide variety of keyword recommendations that are pulled straight from Google — like People Also Ask andPeople Also Search Forkeywords.Regardless of the tool you use, you need something that can help you find topics that make sense for your audience (and that are fairly easy to rank for).Open up your favorite keyword research tool and type in a term related to your product. In our fake company example, this could be something like “outreach” or “email outreach.”Results from “email outreach” with Matching terms selected in Ahrefs.Now, we’ll want to add modifiers/filters to find keywords for our different stages of the content lifecycle/buyer’s journey.Some modifiers I like to use include:How, why, what, examples, example, tool, tools, sample, samples, best, software, top, guide, template, tutorial, course, courses, inspiration, help.Paste these modifiers into your keyword research tool.Keywords in Ahrefs filtered by modifiers.Now we can browse through, or export, this entire list and begin creating content to go after each keyword. Some keywords may be repetitive so you’ll want to have an SEO expert with a good eye tell you which ones you should target and how to prioritize them.In Ahrefs, you can also mess with the KD (keyword difficulty) score to find easier terms to go after. But, depending on the topic, this will drastically lower the number of keyword results. Nevertheless, it’s a good way to find some easy keywords.Now, you can rinse and repeat by changing the main keyword for other things your SaaS product may do. I just showed you “email outreach” as the head term, but we could also explore others like “influencer marketing,” “recruitment,” or “affiliate marketing.”Going through this process, and creating a large list of keywords, will allow us to uncover topics (in demand) for all of our different use cases.As for the 900% increase in traffic example I mentioned at the beginning, I did this for the Webflow blog. With the help of mostly freelance writers, a few people internally, some guest contributors in the web design space, and myself, we launched over 300 blog posts in 24 months on the Webflow blog. Here’s how that turned out:We ended up ranking really well for a lot of keywords:If there’s one thing I would have done differently with Webflow it would have been publishing more blog posts. We published about two to three articles a week. But if we had done four to five articles a week the results could have easily doubled.You live and learn.You can also see from the screenshot above, these URLs are super clean. When creating blog posts, you want to make sure that your URL is only targeting the desired keyword you’re going after.I often see many company blogs post articles with the URL being the exact same as the entire title of the blog post. No, you want to make sure your URL is super clean so Google can better understand what your piece of content is about.For our fake company example, I would launch blog posts like:Title: 10 best outreach tools to try in 2023URL: https://www.reachthem.com/blog/best-outreach-toolsTitle: 20 influencer outreach templates that actually get responsesURL: https://www.reachthem.com/blog/inflencer-outreach-templatesTitle: How to write an outreach email (good and bad examples)URL: https://www.reachthem.com/blog/how-to-write-an-outreach-emailTitle: 10 best recruitment strategies for hiring top talent in 2023URL: https://www.reachthem.com/blog/recruitment-strategiesNotice how some of these are directly related to our fake outreach company. But the last one is just a general post for recruitment teams because we know that our target audience profile, Rachel the recruiter, may be searching for something like this.This is why customer intel is so important. You want to really understand who you are speaking to so you can create resources to help them in their career.You also want your blog post titles to be under 60 characters. This way, they don’t get cut off in Google search results.On the topic of formatting, you’ll also notice how each blog post is in a subfolder similar to our use case and vs page examples.Some will claim that you want your blog posts to be on the root of your domain and not in a subfolder like /blog/.But there’s no strong evidence that states this is a better move for SEO.Some media blogs put their articles on the root domain such as https://reachthem.com/how-to-write-an-outreach-email, while others put them in a subfolder.I like the subfolder approach because it creates a cleaner site architecture that is better for overall user experience. It also lets you create a blog homepage on https://www.reachthem.com/blog that allows you to link out to individual blog posts — this is good forinterlinking.You also want a consistent hierarchy. I’ve seen some company blogs have a blog homepage that lives on https://www.example.com/blog and then they have individual blog posts live on https://www.example.com/post/example-blog-post. If your blog homepage lives on /blog/ make sure your blog posts also live on /blog/. Be consistent.A consistent site hierarchy helps Google scan through your website easier and also improves your overall user experience.Okay, that’s it.Now you’re probably wondering, do these blog posts actually drive conversions? We’ll get into that in the Conversions section of this article.6. Setting up your website for successThis part will be fairly short, and I considered removing it altogether. But I feel there are some important things to mention.This article is not about creating a website, and I already mentioned some things earlier about URL structures.But let me quickly give you some recommendations for setting up your website content:Make sure any piece of content on your website can be accessed with no more than three clicks from your homepage. As in, when I’m on your homepage, I should be able to read a blog post by only having to click something no more than three times.Make sure your navbar links out to your use case pages, vs pages, blog posts, and resource hub. Check outHubSpot’s navbarfor inspiration.Create clear URLs using subfolders: /for/ for use cases, /vs/ for competitor pages, and /blog/ for blog posts.Make sure your footer links out to all of your content, repeat what you have in your navbar and consider adding even more. Check outClickUp’s footerfor inspiration.Make sure you set canonical tags. Check outMoz’s guidefor what they are and how to set them up. You generally set these in your CMS.Make sure you have schema data on your website. Check outthis guidefor what it is and how to set it up. You add these custom code snippets in the code of your web pages.Okay, that’s it. I told you it would be short.7. ConversionsBut now you’re probably wondering, do these blog posts directly drive revenue? The answer is kinda.Writing dozens, even hundreds of blog posts, allows you to continually show up in search results for topics related to your industry and niche. This creates brand awareness and affinity.Attribution can be tricky because not everyone who lands on a blog post will go and sign up for your SaaS product. Sure, some will depending on what level of awareness your blog post lands in. But most people search for stuff on Google to find solutions to problems they have. Once they find a solution, they bounce.But, there are ways to help increase conversions of blog posts. Call this part CRO (conversion rate optimization).Throughout the years, I’ve found that educational resources do really well for conversions. If you’re a SaaS company, you should seriously consider creating free courses, templates, and an educational resource hub. This is why you should start at the bottom of the funnel. Because when you do reach the top of the funnel part of your blog post strategy, you already have resources you can link out to.For example, we could have a blog post that goes after the keyword “email outreach examples.” The article could be titled something like50 amazing email outreach examples that work in 2023.Then, in that article, instead of having a CTA like “Get started,” that sends readers directly to a product sign up page, we can either have a free course on how to send the best outreach email or give readers free email outreach templates. It could also be good to A/B test resources and see which resonates the most for each article.‍The goal then is not to have someone immediately sign up to use our product from a blog post, but rather have them sign up for our free resource.Conversion rates tend to be higher when you approach your blog CTA’s like this. You could even go as far as having your free resource gated as a lead generation tactic. This gated course can then only be opened if someone gives us an email (for retargeting purposes) or if someone creates a free account for your SaaS.So, the conversion flow for a blog post could look like:Inspirational blog article → Free resource → Sign up for productInstead of:Inspirational blog article → Sign up for productThe free resource acts as a bridge to increasing conversions.Here's an example for how HubSpot does it with templates:You can check it outhere.Here's an example for how Webflow does it with courses:You can check it outhere.Here's how DoNotPay does it with product experiences:You can check it outhere.Pretty cool, eh?Lots of big SaaS companies are now doing this.Again, I need to stress that there’s a lot of nuance here. This flow will look different for each company.This style of CTA may not work for every blog post. It may be that this only makes sense for 10% of your articles. You’ll need good judgment as a content marketer when it comes to knowing what resources will be relevant for what blog posts.Hopefully this gives you some inspiration on strategies you can use to increase conversions from blog posts.Time to resultsLastly, for blog posts,don’t expect results in a couple months. Blogging with SEO will take a long time, sometimes up to a year to see meaningful results. To increase your results, you should be posting lots of quality content and SEO optimized blog posts. It’s not a quality vs quantity thing, but rather a qualityandquantity thing. It’s just how content is these days. You need to pay to play with Google.Try to aim to publish one to five blog posts a week for decent results. The closer to five the better. If you’re following a proper keyword strategy, you should start seeing some good results after your first 50 published articles.I know, it’s not easy. Hence, why not every company does it.But once you do have a bunch of high ranking articles on your website, it can act as aMOATfor your startup. Just look at HubSpot’s blog, they literally rank in the top results for most marketing related topics — creating defensibility against their competitors.8. Distributing your contentA mentor of mine once told me, “going from zero to one is really hard. Make sure you piggyback on something.”What he meant was to initially grow on top of other platforms. Look at this:Quora, Pinterest, and Medium grew from Google SEOWebflow initially grew from a post on Hacker NewsGymshark grew from InstagramThousands of media companies are growing from Twitter, YouTube, and TikTokIn content marketing, there’s often a misconception that you first need to create content then distribute it.But really the distribution strategy should come before you even create content.Today, there are so many platforms that curate content. The big platforms also have algorithms to determine what content they should show, and to who they should show it to.If you want your content to distribute itself organically, play to the algorithms.I know some people want to throw their middle finger up to algorithms. But it’s about creating content for humansandrobots. That’s the stuff that reaches the most people.You’d be doing a disservice to those who need your content if you don’t create it in a way that content platforms would want to push.This is why I focus so heavily on SEO for SaaS companies. We are trying to go from zero to one by leveraging Google. It’s literally the first search engine most people go to to look up stuff.If you’re just starting out it’s good to start with one marketing channel and master it. From there you can lay other marketing channels on top to maximize results.In the case of our fake company, ReachThem, I would start with SEO — creating all the pages we talked about earlier. Then, I would go to social media to “remix” this content. By remixing I mean repurposing.Say we have a blog post titled10 best outreach tools to try in 2023.After some time, you can go to Twitter and create a tweet thread with a summary of the blog post. In the last Tweet, you can link out to your blog post for people to learn more.But, be careful.Social media for SaaS companies should not be a place where you just share your blog posts and company updates. People browsing on social media don’t care about that stuff. People on social media want to be entertained, inspired, and/or educated. Lead with those in mind.Play to each channel's algorithm. Create inspiring and educational content on Instagram. Create informational content on Twitter. Create short-form videos on TikTok. Create long-form videos on YouTube. You get the point.The distribution will take care of itself if you’re creating content that plays to a platform's algorithm.The algorithm will depend on things like what the platform wants to show its users and how engaging it is for those users.With YouTube, if you have a high CTR (click through rate) title and thumbnail, and your video has a high watch time, it’s inevitable that it will get views. With Google, if you target the right keywords and make sure all your content is SEO optimized, it’s inevitable that you’ll get some website visitors. If you create high quality Reels on Instagram (because that’s what they’re pushing a lot right now), it’s inevitable that you’ll get views.Places to distribute contentOkay, but what if you just started creating content and want some tactics to promote stuff? Sure, let’s go over some things you can do to help kickstart some of these channels:Guest posting: Guest blogging can seriously help you get more visitors to your website, while also giving you backlinks to increase your domain authority and rank higher in search engines. Here isa great guidefor how to do it. You can also appear on podcasts as a guest to help drive traffic and backlinks.Email marketing: If you have a skilled email or lifecycle marketer on your team they can leverage your content lifecycle diagram to send your existing website content to the right people at the right time.Online communities and aggregators: Posting in online communities is a great way to get the ball rolling. Some platforms includeReddit,Facebook groups,Hacker News,Product Hunt,Marketer Milk,Designer News, and more.Brand partnerships: Do co-marketing campaigns with other brands in your industry. This could be in the form of guest blogging, sharing each other's content on social media, newsletter partnerships, giveaways, and more.Ads and sponsorships: If budget allows, you can “boost” content on Facebook, buy clicks on Google, run display ads, or buy sponsorship placements with media companies.There are many clever ways to promote your website. I wrote a morein depth articleon it if you want to check it out.Anyways, I hope this section makes you think a bit differently about distribution. Again, it’s about piggybacking on a platform and playing to its algorithm. Don’t play on hard mode.9. Creating a system around OKRsOKRs, or objective and key results, is a goal setting system used by a lot of successful companies. It’s about having a clearly defined business goal and creating steps to hit it.In the example of our our fake company, ReachThem, we can have a quarterly content marketing OKR goal set up like this:Objective:Drive 500 sign ups from SEOKey results:Publish 5 use case pages, Publish 3 VS pages, Publish 50 SEO optimized blog postsThe “objective” is the output we want to achieve. The “key results” are the inputs needed to hit the objective.You might ask, how do we know all of our inputs will create 500 sign ups? Well, I made that number up. But this all comes down to attribution (more on that in the next section).It will be hard to create clear OKRs when you’re first starting out. What you need is a lot of data to then create data-informed goals.For the example of ReachThem (remember, I’m making this up), we can see that last quarter we drove 400 sign ups from SEO. So we need to double down on SEO. For this quarter, we set the goal to 500 sign ups (a 25% increase QoQ) and made an informed assumption that our inputs will help us achieve the 500 sign ups goal.The thing with OKRs is that they are just guardrails to make sure we don’t lose focus during the quarter and remember why we are doing the things we are on a day-to-day basis.It takes a skilled leader, with years of experience, to have a good eye for what the objective for the quarter should be. A content marketer shouldn’t necessarily come up with the objective. But they can help the leader figure out what inputs (key results) they believe will help reach the objective.The OKR is also known as a “stretch goal.” If you don’t hit 100% of the goal it’s okay. You’re not really supposed to hit, or exceed, the goal. Hitting 70% of the goal is okay, hitting 80% of the goal is good, and hitting 90% of the goal is great.If you’re hitting less than 70% of the OKR then it’s either a problem of not setting the right objective or having the wrong inputs. On the same token, if you hit way beyond 100% of the goal, you probably set the wrong objective.This is why it takes some time to nail down your OKRs. You need a lot of trial and error, and data, to create effective OKRs.If you’re looking for some examples, here’s a list of over180 marketing OKR examplesyou can check out to get some inspiration.10. ROI and trackingWhen it comes to growth from content marketing, metrics and attribution are everything. If you don’t understand how your content is leading to sign ups then you’re going to have a hard time knowing what to work on.The only issue with attribution is it can get messy.Cookie laws in different countries, Apple removing ad tracking, word of mouth that can’t be tracked properly — all of these can make it difficult to know what’s actually going on.What we can do is do our best with the tools we have.My personal favorite tools for tracking website content areMixpanelandAmplitude. I’ve used both and both are great. Mixpanel is a bit more user friendly, while Amplitude is very engineering heavy and can have a steep learning curve. But they both essentially do the same thing.Now you might be asking, “what about Google Analytics?” That’s a great tool as well. You should have that, or an alternative, set up on your website.A tool like GA (Google Analytics) and Google Search Console are good for tracking how many people are visiting your website, and from where.A tool like Mixpanel and Amplitude are in-productmarketing analytics tools. These tools help you understand user behavior. You’ll be able to better track how people browse on your website, what resources they download or check out, and what leads them to sign up and subscribe to your SaaS.For example, if you set up event tracking correctly in Mixpanel, you’ll be able to tell which blog posts drive the most sign ups. You’ll also be able to tell which sign ups came directly from SEO or other social media platforms.GA and Search Console track website visitors, Mixpanel or Amplitude track what people do on your website.Hope that makes sense.To set up Mixpanel, or Amplitude, you’re going to need a tech savvy person. At large startups, either engineers or growth product teams set these up. It’s a process that can take some time as you’ll need to create event triggers for each action and write a bit of code. Plus, you’ll need some QA’ing and time to pass to make sure the data is flowing through correctly and there are no attribution errors.Some metrics you’ll want to track:Overall website visitors (Google Analytics)Website visitors from SEO (Google Search Console and maybe Ahrefs)Keyword ranking (Ahrefs, or a good rank tracking tool)Sign ups from different pages (Mixpanel or Amplitude)Paying subscribers from different pages (Mixpanel or Amplitude)Newsletter subscribers, if applicable (Mixpanel or Amplitude)Any resources that can be accessed or downloaded (Mixpanel or Amplitude)Hopefully that gives you some clarity on what and how to track. I know I didn’t go over exactly how to set these up, because it’s quite complex and would be a mega blog post on its own. Who knows, depending on when you’re reading this I might have released a blog post on it.Great, you’re on your way to creating an outstanding content marketing operation. Lastly, you’ll need some people to help. Content creation is HARD and takes a lot of effort to do correctly.11. Scaling your content teamThere’s a point in every startup where the founders either have an aha-moment about the power of content or they start seeing unique visitors to their website from content they have produced.In the nature of Capitalism: more, more, and more!I’m only half-joking. *gives side-eye*This is where scaling your content team is going to help accelerate your ROI.I’m going to get some hate for saying this but I feel it’s the truth that I’ve personally experienced.As someone who’s worked as a marketing manager at a marketing agency, in-house at a few SaaS companies, and even worked with other marketing agencies while being in-house, I can tell you that in-house teams always beat outsourced teams.If you’re working at a marketing agency and reading this please don’t hate me. Take it as inspiration to prove me wrong. I know I’m overgeneralizing here.There’s a level of understanding about your product and brand that content marketing agencies just can’t reach. They can’t afford to because they have other clients to worry about.The best content marketing teams I’ve seen first have one or more in-house content manager(s), editor(s), and copywriter(s) that then work with freelancers, and external contributors, to help accelerate content output.As a content marketing manager, you want to get good at knowing what content works for your company, what that content should look like, and how to get the right person to produce it.In the case of use case pages, VS pages, and a few product-oriented blog posts, you’ll want someone in-house driving strategy and production of your content marketing efforts.The scaling comes best when you’re trying to cast your net far and target more keywords with blog posts. This is when you can hire freelance writers and editors to help you.If you don’t have the budget, you can have people internally at your company help create content if they’re subject matter experts. But don’t rely on this.More often than not, a coworker gets excited about contributing to their company blog but then their own work demands get in the way. It causes too much back and forth and delays in your content calendar. If you’re a small startup this may not be the case. But if you have say over 100 employees at your company, it can be an unreliable strategy and causes unnecessary headaches.So, here’s how to scale your content team.Hiring for contentHave at least one content marketing manager in-house that drives strategy. If possible, also get at least one copywriter and editor to help write and publish content to your CMS.From there, begin to hire just one freelance writer to get a feel for it. There are plenty of great places to find freelance writers.Content Writing Jobs,ProBlogger, andUpworkare a few good ones.For freelance writers, find about three candidates on a writing job posting site and give each candidate the same exact topic. Pick the writer that you deem did the best job.You can also hire a freelance editor and train them on your brand and voice guidelines to make sure your content is clean before it goes out. The content marketing manager can also do this, but they will quickly become the bottleneck if you’re trying to output several pieces of content a week (speaking from experience).For the editor, find three candidates and give them all the same blog post draft to edit. Just like the writer, pick the editor you deem did the best job.Over time, you’ll create a nice network of freelance writers and editors you can tap into whenever you want to scale up or down your content output.Ifhiring writersseems intimidating at first, you can also outsource your content creation to a company that already has a network of freelance writers. I wrote a list of someseo content writing servicesyou can check out.Most of these content writing services charge you by word count. For reference, you can find freelance writers ranging from $0.05 a word to over $1 a word. It all depends on if the writer is proficient in English and their experience level. Experience can be in the form of industry, topical experience, and number of good articles they’ve written for other companies. In the case of content writing services, most will run you about $0.10 a word.Scaling a content team will look different for each company. Some will have more people in-house, some will outsource a large portion of their team, and some will even outsource their entire team.If you want to completely outsource your team it can be pricey, butwe can do it for you(contract-free) if it's something you're looking for.Okay, that’s it.ConclusionWoah, that was a lot.

This stems from slow returns and misconceived value because some businesses still choose to ignore a key piece of their marketing plan: content.However, an effective B2B SaaS content marketing strategy can render itself invaluable in the long term by elevating your brand awareness and establishing yourself as an industry thought leader. It’s also important to reaffirm your market positioning by offering helpful, insightful resources to your audiences.According toDemand Gen Report’s 2020 Content Preferences Study, buyers are not only leaning even harder on content to educate themselves, but they are also demanding and expecting richer content experiences. In fact, 67% say they rely more on content now than ever before, making it a tactic B2B SaaS companies just can’t ignore.Download Your Guide to Building a Bold B2B SaaS Content StrategyBuild editorial content calendars and promote your strategy with content strategy checklists.Start creating content with templates, persona profiles and tips for funnel stage alignment and lead nurturing.An overview of B2B SaaS content marketingContent marketing is a form of inbound marketing that focuses on providing the right content to the right customer at the right time. It’s one of the most essential elements of SaaS marketing ––helping customers understand the product. Specifically, content marketing uses a strategic approach for content––including all of your blog posts, emails, eBooks, landing pages, advertisements, and more.SaaS content marketing is competitive––it’s all about creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to not only attract but also retain a clearly defined audience. Developing asolid positioning and messaging frameworkwill allow you to create solid content and align all efforts across your company.Your positioning, messaging and content should show them how your product works and how it can solve their problems, then you can guide them towards testing out your tools. Essentially, SaaS content marketing allows you to take a less overtly “sales-y” approach to reach new customers and position your brand as a thought leader in the industry. This way, when a potential customer is ready to invest, your product will be the obvious choice.Concerned about whether or not your audience will actually read your content? Not only do more B2B buyers read more content now, but48% of themread 3-5 blog posts or content pieces prior to even talking with a salesperson.Aligning your SaaS GTM strategy with content marketingYour content marketing strategy will ultimately depend on yourgo-to-market (GTM) strategy. This ensures you can deliver your unique selling proposition to the right ICP so you can position and differentiate yourself from other competitors in the industry.Search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketingSearch engine optimization (SEO)is the bread and butter of your content marketing, which is how many of your prospective clients will find you. It’s how you grab the attention of search engines. Think about it –– every time you Google something, millions and millions of results pop up, and yours can too.If you are interesting and appealing to your audience and are using specific keywords and phrases, you are more likely to rank. Write high-quality and shareable content in searcher’s terms and be sure to choose keywords based on relevance, competition, and the number of searches.Pro Tip:SEO and blog creation are the top two inbound marketing priorities for marketers. In order to step up your marketing strategy and online presence, focus on publishing regular content aligned directly with SEO research and strategy so you can deliver scalable and long-term results.B2B SaaS content marketing goalsFor SaaS and B2B companies like Kalungi, your goals should look similar to the four content marketing goals below.Create brand awarenessEducate your customersBuild credibility and trustGenerate leadsAs Mr. Seth Godin says, you have to beremarkable, as high-quality, purposeful content is how you can find your best new prospects. Compelling content not only can showcase your company’s expertise, but it can also attract links, get social media shares, and be a part of conversations.Your content and brand are how people are going to find you and it’s your job to make sure they can.Don’t just talk about how your product or service can solve a problem, show your audience how it does. Be sure to highlight the qualities that set your brand apart from your competitors so they will remember you.An educated customer is a happy customer. Educating prospective customers is one of the most efficient topics of B2B SaaS content marketing. To educate, write valuable content and talk about the benefits of your product or service––help your prospects imagine a life with it and where they can’t live without it.Part of writing good, compelling, and educating content is to understand your audience, their pain points, and their objections. Start by having your sales team record the questions they hear the most often from their customers––these could be a good starting point for content ideas.For example, if your customers think your product will be too complicated to use, you can write content that explains and demonstrates how you use it. Your content should be about how implementing your product or service can benefit your audience and prospective customers in the long run.Pro Tip:Understand the objections that keep your prospective customers from buying in, and then think about creative ways to resolve those objections through content.Everyone wants to build credibility and trust, and the best way to do that is through content.When you create valuable, useful, and interesting content, your audience learns they can trust you and they can see that you know your topic. Not only that, but building credibility also allows them to get a sense of your personality and what it would be like to work with you.Pro Tip:Remember, it’s not the medium that matters...it’s the message. Write about the experience, not just the product and its features. If you have an abundance of valuable content, you are more likely to keep the conversation going.The ultimate goal of B2B SaaS inbound marketing is to generate leads, so it’s likely going to be the objective for a lot of your B2B SaaS content. Generate leads through content by addingCTAs and formswithin each of your blogs and landing pages.Good lead generation starts with a solid SaaS content marketing strategy. Be sure to add tracking links so you can easily measure as well.How to build a B2B SaaS content strategyIn order to meet your content marketing goals, you need to have a solid content marketing strategy.Your B2B SaaS content marketing strategy boils down to figuring out what content will help your target audience and inspire them to take actions that boost your business.A solid content calendar can do wonders for growing your blog and website, as long as it also includes producing top-quality content, and distributing it successfully.Whether you’re writing up a case study, creating an eBook, drafting up a whitepaper, sending out a survey, or writing a how-to guide, etc., make sure it has a purpose for your audience and aligns with your strategy. And don’t underestimate it –good nurturesequences can also go a long way.Learn how to create acontent marketing strategy here.Let the B2B SaaS Buyer’s Journey guide youWhen planning and writing content, you should always target a specificstage of the buyer’s journey. The following is how much of your strategy you should pour into each stage of the funnel to ensure you aren’t dumping all of your eggs in one basket.50% Awareness Stage (Why change?)It all begins with brand awareness. This allows you to become a resource and thought leader in your industry. In this stage, your audience simply becomes aware of your business. They aren’t necessarily ready to buy in yet or join your email list or newsletter, but because of the valuable content you created, they now know who you are.In the awareness stage, you are educating your audience, creating brand awareness, and building trust and credibility. So many marketers stop there, but there is much more to the journey in order to drive business and profit.30% Consideration Stage (Why you?)Once people become aware of your business, they typically need to take time to consider, which is where you can create somenurturing and thought leadership contentto get them to consider buying from you.SaaS content marketing is a great way to move your audience through the consideration stage. In this stage, you want to continue to build credibility and trust through blogs, eBooks, and webinars and provide a little more direct value than you would in the awareness stage.Pro Tip:If you can stay in contact with your prospective clients during the consideration phase, you’ll have a better chance of converting those people to paying customers.15% Decision Stage (Why now?)Now that your customers have not only become aware of your business, but they trust you and are considering buying in, it’s time for them to make the decision. They are either going to become a paying customer or not. This is your chance to deliver content that converts such as webinars, guides, and blogs.5% Retention & Advocacy (Why continue?)How do you hold onto customers who are paying? You need to create content that keeps them happy. Reach out to them via email or social media to see how they are liking the platform and if they have any challenges or areas that could be improved. You can also create user guides or one-pagers to add more value to their experience with your service.Govern your marketing teamWhen it comes to your B2B SaaS content strategy, governing your team is crucial. Follow RACI to move through your strategy and hold people accountable so you can minimize bottlenecks and keep the ball rolling––nothing is worse than sitting on a finished piece of content for weeks because team members were not aligned.R - Responsible - Who is responsible?A - Approver - Who approves of the content?C - Consulted - Who needs to be consulted?I - Informed - Who needs to be informed?Once you have determined who is accountable for which position on your team, you can ensure efficiency and consistency as you move through your strategy and publish content.How to generate content ideasWhen it comes to your B2B SaaS content marketing plan, start by identifying yourideal audience (or ICP)so you can create highly actionable, engaging, and valuable content and move them through the customer journey and drive sales.While a lot of your content will be fueled by campaigns and your overall marketing strategy, there may be a time that you need to think of more ideas. If you’re stuck on what to write about, below are some questions you can ask to spark some ideas for valuable SaaS marketing content.What are your client’s pain points? How can you solve them?What gaps exist when it comes to knowledge in your industry?Can you comment on future trends in your space?How do customers benefit from your product or service?How do your customers use the solution?What do customers need to know from you to get their first moment of value as soon as possible?When it comes to B2B SaaS content marketing, start by identifying your ideal audience so you can create highly actionable, engaging and valuable content and move them through the customer journey and drive profit.Pro Tip:As a basis for all of your content, make sure you answer a common customer question: “What’s in it for me?”. In other words, always be customer-focused.Create SaaS content that engages and convertsLast but not least, I’ll leave you with some tips for creating a solid piece of SaaS content because whether you’re writing a blog, whitepaper, eBook, or landing page, there is a certain science to creating SaaS content that engages your audience and converts them into a paying customer.Address your audience’s pain, followed by a claim + gainFocus on writing for SEOAlways add imagesSprinkle in some CTAsGet your SaaS on searchSaaS content marketing is one of the most powerful tools your team can leverage in order to attract, educate and convert customers. While it may take time to see returns on content strategy, that doesn’t mean it’s not working––patience is critical here.The nature of search engine optimization and garnering market share through content marketing and thought leadership takes long-term, consistent work in order to establish a solid positioning. Don’t give up at the start. As long as you continue to publish goodSEO contentthat speaks to your audience and follows your strategy, you’re bound to see results.Keep up the good work and see you on the internet :)d nurtuDownload Your Guide to Building a Bold B2B SaaS Content StrategyBuild editorial content calendars and promote your strategy with content strategy checklists.Start creating content with templates, persona profiles and tips for funnel stage alignment and lead nurturing.Similar postsContent MarketingBeginner's guide to B2B SaaS SEO content: Strategy, tools and tipsB2B SaaS SEO content is a cornerstone of marketing.

SaaS Content Marketing Strategy (2023 ROI-Driven Guide) - QuoleadyServicesClientsAbout usBlogLet's talk+1 917-540-9541AllCase StudiesContent writingGuidesLink BuildingOur journeyGuidesSaaS Content Marketing Strategy (2023 ROI-Driven Guide)Olga MykhoparkinaJan 16, 2023We’ve been in SaaS marketing for over seven years and we tried different strategies until we found the one that brings the most leads.Our client list includes big SaaS companies such as Monday.com, PandaDoc, Expandi, GetVoip and many others, but we also work with new SaaS brands that want to leverage their blogs.When we create content for our clients, our goal is not only to boost their website traffic but to get more people to actually buy their product. We help them do that through a high-intent content strategy that I’m about to share with you.You can have the similar results we’ve had for our clients if you follow the SaaS content marketing strategy you’ll learn in this article.But let’s start from the base.Why is content marketing important for SaaS companies?According to the Content Marketing Institute,content marketing has a higher ROI than other types of marketing, such as traditional advertising.SaaS content productionnot only costs you less than paid promotions, but it can also have a long-lasting effect that can bring you new leads for months and years after you’ve published your content.This is especially important for small and medium SaaS companies that have a limited marketing budget and want to get the most out of it.Thousands of people are googling SaaS-related questions every day. They’re looking for solutions to their problems and comparing different SaaS brands online.If you find out their pain points and help them solve them through your content, you can position your SaaS brand as the logical solution for them. And that’s the whole point of SaaS content marketing.It helps you to reach your target audience through helpful content and move them down your sales funnel until they become your clients.Here are some of the things you can get through content marketing:Increasing brand awarenessConverting your readers into paid customersBoosting website trafficBuilding trustImproving lead generationReducing customer acquisition costPositioning your SaaS business as an industry leaderWhat is a SaaS content marketing strategy?A SaaS content marketing strategy is a long-term plan of creating and distributing content with the aim to attract your target audience, educate and engage them and convert them into paying customers.A SaaS content marketing strategy is a part of a broaderinbound marketingapproach that’s all about naturally drawing customer interest toward your company, instead of pushing them with paid content promotion.Here are four aspects to consider when creating your overall content marketing strategy:1. Your target audienceThe first step is to learn more about your target audience and their pain points so that you can create your buyer persona.Think about your ideal clients. What’s bothering them? What are their goals? What problems can your SaaS product solve them?If you’re in a B2B SaaS business, you also need to identify who are the decision-makers in the company and who are the end users of your product. What’s their job title? What’s motivating them?2. Your goalsNext, define your long-term and short-term goals. Do you want to increase sales? Or, is your SaaS business brand new and you want to first increase brand awareness?You can also have multiple goals, depending on where your clients are in their customer journey.Without clear goals, you can’t track your content marketing efforts and see what works.3. Keyword researchI believe that optimized content for Google is the best and quickest way to reach your target audience and that’s why keyword research must be part of your content strategy.The first step is to find out the keywords your potential customers are searching for in Google, and only when you have found them, it’s time to create content around those keywords.4. Your competitorsAnalyze other SaaS businesses in your industry and their content. Having competitors isn’t bad because it means there’s demand for a product like yours and you can also learn a lot from them.Type your main keyword on Google and check out the blog posts that appear first in organic search.What is good about their SaaS content and what could be improved? Are there any angles  that they haven’t covered and that you can use to position your blog posts higher on Google?Content analysis can help you come up with your competitive advantage.What makes a SaaS content marketing strategy successful?Here are four things that could determine your success:Being customer-centric.There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. The success of your content marketing strategy depends on how well you get to know your customers and how well you can deliver what they’re looking for.Finding the balance between people and SEO.Your blog should be a central part of your SaaS content marketing strategy and you should strive to create content people find interesting and useful, but also make sure to optimize it for Google.Setting SMART goals.The best way to measure your content marketing success is to set SMART goals. Your goals have to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.Putting it into action.Finally, even the best strategy won’t work unless you don’t put in the work. Start to create content and be consistent. You may not see results overnight but stick to it. Your content marketing efforts will pay off and have a compound effect over time.There are a number of other things that contribute to the overall success of the SaaS content marketing strategy. Devil is in the details and if you want to know more content tips and hacks, keep reading ourblog.Why we focus on high-intent SaaS content marketing strategyWhen talking to SaaS company owners, I often hear that they want to rank for a “big fat” keyword in their industry, keywords with the highest search volume. But what they don’t realize is that it would take them years and a lot of money to get there.Let me illustrate this. If your SaaS company has recruitment software, the first instinct would be to try to rank on Google for “recruitment software”. But let’s take a closer look at that keyword.You’ll see that it’s “super hard” to rank for, the websites already ranking for it have a high DA and the amount of backlinks they’ve acquired over time is enormous. It’d take you 329 backlinks just to get in the top 10 search results! That’s insane.Based on the competition, you’d have to grow your domain authority to 80 (which can take years) and get at least 100 backlinks to a blog post (which can cost thousands of dollars).And the worst part is that even that won’t guarantee that you’ll be among the first search results. Why? Because your competition is not sleeping, they’re working on improving their content and getting new backlinks every day.See why you shouldn’t focus your marketing efforts on chasing those big popular keywords? It’s just too much effort and sometimes you simply can’t win.What to do instead? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.I suggest focusing on strategies that will bring you the biggest ROI.We experimented with different content strategies and found thathigh-intent SaaS content strategycan bring you the most leads at the lowest budget, and also pretty quickly, allowing you to skip the whole lead nurturing process.The goal is to target people that are already at the bottom of the sales funnel and that have shown high-purchasing intent.Here are some high-intent content ideas for creating bottom funnel content:1. AlternativesIf you’re a brand new SaaS company and nobody is searching for your brand on Google, don’t worry. Here’s what you can do instead.Identify your main competitors, top SaaS businesses in your niche, and use a keyword research tool to find out how many people are looking for their alternatives.Those people could be your ideal clients. They’re probably not satisfied with the software they currently have, and they’re looking for other options, which allows you to position your product as a logical solution.If you’re in email marketing industry, your keywords could look like this:Mailchimp alternativesOmnisend alternativesMailerlite alternatives2. ComparisonsIf you’re a new SaaS brand, unfortunately, people probably aren’t googling your SaaS product yet. But you can position your article among search engine results pages for your more famous competitors.You should write an in-depth and honest review of each tool, comparing their features, pros and cons, who can get the most out of the tool, and so on.If you manage to write a more detailed guide than the ones that are currently ranking, Google could give you a boost and even use your content for a featured snippet.The idea isn’t to put your competitors into bad light, but to emphasize the features that make your product a better fit for X audience.Let’s use the email marketing example again. Here are keywords you can use:Mailchimp vs MailerliteMailchimp or MailerliteOmnisend vs MailerliteWrite a detailed description of each tool and then add a paragraph about your tool showcasing some features that other tools may not have. There are many people that will want to check out this new tool!Bonus tip: Don’t be afraid of review platforms like G2 or Capterra. Yes, their content may rank as the first result, but it’s often generic and lacks structure. Most people are looking for a more detailed guide than those platforms can offer.3. How to guidesHow-to guides are one version ofproduct-led contentthat is very sought after. The idea is to help readers solve their problems using your product. Check out this article on Pandadoc blog, it teaches you how to write a business proposal while introducing you to the product (business proposal software) and offering to try their ready-to-use templates.You can create educational content by answering the most common search queries and questions related to the problem you solve. These articles are a mix of creating valuable content for your audience and positioning your SaaS product as the best solution for them.How to automate email marketingHow to start email marketingHow to create email marketing sequence4. ListiclesAnd finally, listicles, another highly-requested type of content.They give you a chance to position your product in the same line as the most famous SaaS brands in your industry.But don’t get tricked, because it’s not enough to simply rank 10 most popular tools and add a brief description of each software. There are already hundreds of similar articles on Google.If you want to stand out you have to be willing to put in some work and go in-depth with reviewing each tool.Your success with listicles will depend on your niche and how saturated it is. For some niches, it’s a waste of time, but in other niches you may discover a blue ocean of possibility.Sometimes you won’t be able to rank for the most obvious keyword and in that case, try to make it more specific. Yes, search volume might be lower, but the chance for conversion is higher, the more specific you get.That’s how we helped our client Expandi rank #1 on Google for “top Linkedin automation tools for lead generation” with thislisticle.Here are a few additionalB2B blog writing tips:Put your SaaS tool #1 on the list, because many people don’t read the full article.Use the main keyword as H1, but add supportive keywords in H2 throughout the article.Check the “People also ask” section on Google to find inspiration for additional keywords, topics you can cover and FAQs.Specify who can benefit from each tool the most.Add multiple CTAs throughout the article.13 Steps of SaaS content marketing strategyHere’s the step-by-step process we use when creating a content marketing strategy for our clients.1. Market analysis and identifying buyer personaWhether you’re a new or an established SaaS company, I’d recommend starting with market research.Identify your main competitors and then do a detailed analysis of their content. Observing the articles that are ranking high on Google can help you come up with some content ideas.Take note of things they’re doing well, but also try to spot topics that they haven’t covered that well. You could use that as a competitive advantage when creating your own content strategy.Before you begin creating content, you should identify your buyer persona. Content creation gets much easier when you know who your ideal customer is and what they’re looking for.Here are some questions to help you out:What problem can your product solve for your customers?What is your potential customer searching on Google? Identify their questions and doubts so that you can address them through your content.What is the job title of your ideal customer? In which industry they’re working?Where do they go when they want to get informed? Which websites do they visit, which podcasts do they listen to, who do they follow on social media, etc?What does their typical customer journey look like?2. Performing keyword researchBefore you start writing your blog posts, it’s essential to do keyword research and find relevant keywords you can base your content around.You can use SEO tools like Ahrefs and SemRush. The first step is to check whether there is a search demand for a solution like yours. Are people searching for that type of SaaS on Google? And what keywords are they using?You can check related keywords to get some inspiration when choosing the right words.3. Prioritizing keywords to cover in blog postsHere’s a formula we use at Quoleady. The goal is to find the balance between these three things:High search volumeLow keyword difficultyHigh intentYou should find keywords with a reasonable search volume, but there’s no need to chase keywords with the biggest search volume. They’re probably already covered by your competitors and it’d take you tons of money to outperform them.Let me illustrate this with an example. If you were a new email marketing software, it’d be pretty unrealistic to rank for the keyword “email marketing tool”, because big players such as Mailchimp, Omnisend and others, have already covered those popular keywords.That’s why I’d suggest looking foralternative keywordswith a solid search volume, but lower keyword difficulty, that are less competitive.Among all these things, I’d focus most on search intent.By focusing on high-intent keywords, you’re targeting people that are most likely ready to buy. They’re at the end of the marketing funnel and they show high purchasing intent.Here’s a practical example of what it looks like to find the balance but prioritize search intent:4. Coming up with the winning titlesOver the years of working in the SaaS industry, I realized most titles are pretty much the same, especially when it comes to listicles.You can check it yourself. Just go on Google, type your keyword and see what comes up. You’ll probably see something likeX Top %Tool% alternatives you’ll love/ need to check/ that work.That’s your chance to shine and use your creativity to create eye-catching titles that will drive organic traffic to your website.Don’t forget to use your main keyword in the title. It’d be ideal if you could put it at the beginning of the title!You can use CoSchedule Headline Analyzer to see whether you can improve your title. CoSchedule can assess whether your title is clear and skimmable, whether it should have more or fewer words and it’ll give you many suggestions to improve the title, as you can see in the picture below.If you notice that you’re getting fewer website visitors over time, it can be a good idea to change the title and see if CTR is going to change. Experiment with changing titles every once in a while until you find the one that converts the best.Here’s a quick tip: adding the month and the year can instantly increase your CTR because people want to read fresh news and insights.5. Producing quality content regularlyYour SaaS content strategy should be a marathon, not a sprint. We’re looking for long-term results here.You can’t publish a few high-quality blog posts and expect overnight results. Consistency is key and the good news is that Google favors websites that consistently post new content.The competition in the SaaS industry is enormous and some of our well-established clients are posting 30-60 blog posts per month!I’m not saying that you should focus on quantity over quality. Only quality content can help you rank on search engines and get leads.Take your time to do thorough research and create content that adds value to your readers. You should strive to write in-depth articles that are more detailed than your competitors’ blog posts.Write in a way that’s easy to understand and filled with actionable advice that can be applied instantly. Use everyday language and keep your sentences short and simple.Divide your content into bite-sized paragraphs and add plenty of subtitles to make it easier for a reader to skim the article and find the information they’re looking for.We shared plenty of tips forSaaS content writingin this article.Create a content calendar to help you plan your content and stay on track.6. Optimizing your SaaS content for SEOWhen you create SaaS content the goal should be to find the balance between giving value to your readers and optimizing your article for search engines.I’ve already talked about keyword research, but there are more things to do to make sure your content is optimized for Google.Here are a few quick SEO tips:Add your main keywords to the title tag, headings and URL slug.Keep your URLs clear and simple, because it makes it easier to navigate your website.Add relevant ALT tags to images.Fix technical SEO (page speed, broken links, site map, etc.)Make sure your content is optimized for mobile phones.Links are also an important part of search engine optimization, and I’ll go into more detail about them below.Read this article if you want to learn more aboutSEO for a SaaSblog.7. Optimizing your SaaS content for conversionOne mistake I often see is people giving a lot of value through their content, but forgetting that they’re here to sell.People are much more likely to sign up or buy your SaaS product if you tell them exactly what you want them to do. That’s in our nature. We need reminders all the time.Therefore, don’t forget to add CTAs through the article and encourage potential customers to sign up in the text.I recommend placing a few CTAs throughout the content piece because the attention span is getting shorter and shorter and most people need to see it multiple times.If you want to make sure your CTAs stand out, check out what we did for our client Expandi. Instead of using plain textual CTAs, we added eye-catching banners throughout the text.8. Working on content upgradesYou have to constantly produce content for people in different stages of the marketing funnel to get their attention and turn them into paying customers.In this article, I focused a lot on high-intent and BOFU content because it brings quick results, but it doesn’t mean you should ignore top and mid-funnel content.When it comes to TOFU content, your main goal should be to capture the email of your website visitors so that you can continue with lead nurturing.People will give you their email address only if they perceive they can get something valuable in return, something that they can’t easily find on other websites. That’s why it’s important to create in-depth content and make sure it’s up-to-date with the latest industry news.Here are some content formats that you can use as a lead magnet:EbooksIndustry reportsWhite papersCase studiesInfographicsChecklistsToolkitsSometimes you don’t have to start from scratch. Go through your old content and see whether there’s something you can repurpose. For example, if you had a series of blog posts around one topic cluster, you can turn them into an ebook on that topic and use it as a lead magnet.9. Setting up the lead nurturing processSometimes a potential customer needs more time and information before they make a final decision, especially in the B2B world, where there are multiple decision-makers.That’s why you need to set the whole nurturing process.First, go to Google Ads Manager to enable retargeting people who already visited your website.Second, create lead magnets to get people to give you their email/sign up for your newsletter.Once you have their emails, you should nurture them by providing with valuable content on a regular basis. ou can send them special offers.Speaking about email marketing strategy, the word to remember is – consistency. Make sure to deliver what you’ve promised.If you said that you’ll send two newsletters every month, then stick to that schedule, and your efforts will pay off over time.If you want to boost your lead generation and nurturing efforts, make sure that you track all important metrics: open rate, click-through rate, conversion rate, channels that bring you the most leads, etc. That’s the only way to see what works, optimize your content and speed up the customer journey.10. Adding internal links wiselyWhile most content marketers are talking about external links, you shouldn’t underestimate thepower of internal linksas well.Do you want a quick hack on how to boost organic traffic to your latest blog posts?Go through your older blog posts (those that are performing well and have a solid number of backlinks) and add a link that leads to your latest blog post.But, be careful when choosing articles for internal linking and avoid thin content.If you’re not sure where to start or have limited resources, I’d prioritize linking to articles that need a ranking boost.On the other side, when choosing the old articles to link from, choose the articles that already rank high in organic search and have a lot of backlinks.What’s the ideal number of internal links? It depends on the length of your article! We experimented with different amounts of internal links, and we discovered that using 15+ internal links gave much better results compared to 5-10 links we used in the past (of course, I’m not talking about short articles, most of our articles are 2000-3000 words long).Make sure that you’re keeping it relevant by linking to articles that are connected to the topic and are providing additional value to the reader. Avoid internal link stuffing, linking just for the sake of linking.11. Updating old content regularlyWith time, your content may lose some of its ranking on Google. But the good news is that you can keep your ranking if you make sure that your content is always up-to-date.That’s something we do for our clients on a regular basis, every few months. Here’s what I would do:Check if all information is relevant and accurate.Add new industry insights and stats.Add internal links to the new blog posts you’ve published.Make sure that you’ve covered all topics that your competitors cover on their web pages.Update your titles.Here’s one thing you can do today. Go through your old blog posts and update the year in the title and the text, from 2022 to 2023. This simple action can improve your CTR, because people tend to click more on articles that seem relevant and fresh.12. Building external linksBacklinks are one of the top ranking factors. All SaaS content marketers agree that when it comes to a competitive niche, it’s hard to rank even the best content unless it has high-quality backlinks.Now that you know this, it can be tempting to buy backlinks or get them from content farms and random portals. You’ve probably gotten an email like that a few times:But don’t do that.My advice is to pick quality over quantity when it comes to external links.Here’s how to build high-quality external links without spending tons of money:1. Guest bloggingGuest blogging is basically writing content for another blog or platform and sharing your expertise.Link buildingis not the only benefit of this tactic. It also allows you to expose your SaaS brand to a new audience, position yourself as an industry leader and build relationships with people in your industry.I can personally recommend this strategy because I was invited to write articles for many platforms as a guest contributor. You can check some of them out because they can be useful:The Staircase Guest Blogging Strategythat was published on HubSpot.3 SaaS Content Marketing Strategies that Bring Leadsfor Zapier.How to Design a Website Exit Pop-up That Significantly Boosts Email Sign-upsthat was published on Entrepreneur.You can reach out to other platforms and offer to write articles for them, but make sure to choose a platform that is relevant to your industry and has consistent traffic.2. HAROHelp a Reporter Out (HARO) is a platform that connects journalists with sources.Every day hundreds of journalists are looking for information and industry insights from relevant sources to back up their articles with. If they choose you as a source, you’ll get a backlink when the article is published.You can sign up for the HARO newsletter, select the industries you want to follow, and you’ll get emails every day with requests from journalists related to your industry.How to make sure that the journalist picks you as a source?Make sure to respond to their requests quickly, read emails daily.Back up your articles with examples from your personal experience instead of writing generic articles that can already be found on Google.We’ve been able to achieve some great placements for our clients including platforms like Forbes, Entrepreneur, Yahoo, Business Insider and many more. It doesn’t happen every day but it can definitely work.3. Statistics postsThe reason why there are a lot of statistics articles online is because they work and people love reading them!Creating an in-depth statistical piece of content may be time-consuming but it’ll pay off once other people start linking to you as a source and it’ll happen because everyone needs to back up their articles.Try to use your own statistics wherever you can. Of course, you can also add other stats but make sure to link to the original source.4. A-B-C exchangesDirect link swapping is an outdated strategy and it won’t help you much, because Google recognizes websites that link to each other.However… 3-way link exchange is more complex and harder to detect.Basically, you need 3 websites with high DA and similar niches.Site 1 links to Site 2, Site 2 links to Site 3 and Site 3 links to site 1.Everyone is getting backlinks and there are no reciprocal links, that are considered low-quality links.5. Link gap analysisYou can use SEO tools to discover websites that are linking to your competitors but aren’t linking to your website. Send them an outreach email and propose a collaboration.If they’re linking to multiple websites in your industry, chances are they’ll accept your offer as well. But remember that it’s a numbers game and don’t get discouraged if you don’t get the answer you want. Keep going.If you want more info, read this guide to find outhow to choose websites for SaaS link buildingand avoid scammers.13. Distributing SaaS contentWhen it comes to a content distribution strategy, I’d focus my marketing efforts on your blog and Google.Let me explain why I think Google is the best marketing channel for SaaS companies. If you write an optimized article that ranks on Google, it can bring you evergreen traffic for months and even years, if you update it regularly.On the other hand, other channels like social media or paid ads can get you only a one-time spike, without lasting results.With Google, you can get organic traffic and marketing qualified leads almost for free. That’s why I believe quality content and search engine optimization have the biggest ROI compared to other strategies.Of course, you can use other marketing channels as part of your content distribution strategy, especially if your target audience is there. For B2B products, I’d focus on Linkedin, Quora and other online communities where people are looking for industry-related information.But if you want long-term results, I’d advise you to direct your marketing efforts toward creating high-quality content for people who search it on Google.SaaS content marketing tools you’ll need:Here arethe toolsour content team uses on a daily basis:Grammar tools:Grammarly is much more than a simple grammar tool. It also helps you improve the clarity of your writing, choose the right tone of voice, etc.Keyword research tools: You can use either Ahrefs or SemRush to do keyword research, check search volume and keyword difficulty and get related keyword ideas.Content optimization tools:Apart from keyword research tools, you need tools that help you optimize your article for Google. We useSurferSEOfor writing and optimizing articles. SurferSEO gives you guidelines on what you can improve and my advice is to aim for a content score of 70 or above (the higher the better). Or you can try another great alternative –Outranking.io.Title tools:You can use CoSchedule Headline Analyzer to improve your titles (it gives suggestions on title length, skimmability, emotion, etc.) and Capitalize My Title for capitalization.AI tools:Writesonic is one of the best AI writing tools. You can use it for editing and polishing articles.Plagiarism checker:We use Copyscape, but there are plenty of other options as well.Project management tools:You’ll need one, especially if you have a big content team. At Quoleady, we use Notion, but you could also try Trello, Asana or any other project management tool that works for you and your team.Analytics tools:Finally, you have to track the performance of your content, and the tools that can help you do so are Google Analytics and Google Search Console. You can also track keyword positions in Ahrefs or other SEO tools.SaaS content marketing strategy examplesWe helped multiple SaaS companies achieve amazing results through our high-intent strategy.1. FullSessionFullSession is a behavioral analytics software with whom we started working in 2021. When they reached out to us, their website was brand new, with zero backlinks and DA 2.Here’s what we did:We based their content strategy on high-intent keywords and their competitor keywords. It means that we created a series of articles with alternatives, comparisons and reviews (e.g. “HotJar alternatives”, “HotJar vs Inspectlet”)Through HARO and SaaS partnerships, we acquired high-quality backlinks that helped to build their DA and rank their blog posts on Google.We did acontent auditand replaced thin content with in-depth articles, changed the structure of the articles, added more CTAs.Here are some of the results after only a few months:1.500 new leadsOrganic traffic went from 0 to over 40.000 visitsDA went from 2 to 49Conversion rate improved 9 timesYou can read the fullcase studyhere.2. RingBlazeRingBlaze is a virtual phone system. When we started working with them, they already had a blog, but it didn’t bring them any traffic or leads. We had to reinvent their content marketing strategy from scratch.Here’s what we did:We focused on competitor keywords in order to position RingBlaze as the best alternative for other, more famous, virtual phone systems.We made sure that their articles were more in-depth and better quality than already existing content on Google.We used different methods to get them high-quality backlinks to help rank their content on Google and boost their visibility (guest blogging, HARO, outreach)Here are some of the results after only a few months:650 new leadsBlog traffic went from 0 to 50.000DA went from 8 to 30They got featured on WallStreet JournalYou can read the fullcase studyhere.Leave SaaS content strategy to the expertsOne of the common mistakes SaaS companies make is starting to create content without a strategy in place. They think they can figure it out along the way, but here’s what actually happens:Without a strategy, it’s hard to be consistent and stick to content creation in busy periods.It’s hard to measure your progress and see if you’re coming closer to your goals.However, I know it can be hard to focus on the bigger picture when you have so many things going on on a regular basis, especially if you’re a new SaaS brand or don’t have a huge content marketing team.That’s why I suggest hiring aSaaS content strategistto help you out and give you guidelines you can follow.Here’s how to choose the right content strategist for your SaaS brand:You can ask other SaaS founders for a recommendation, look in SaaS groups or on Linkedin.When you find someone that seems to be an expert, check their previous experience and the results they’ve created for their clients.Make sure that the person has worked with SaaS companies from the same industry as you (someone can be great when it comes to overall marketing strategy, but if they don’t know how the SaaS industry works, that can be a big problem).Once you have a strategy in place, content creation becomes much easier because you know exactly where you are going and what you have to do.SummaryWe’ve covered a lot in this article, but if I had to sum it up in three steps to help you increase yourcontent marketing ROI, here’s what I’d do:Write for people but optimize for Google. Your articles should be value-packed, in-depth and easy to read, but you also have to consider ranking factors if you want to get traffic from Google.When doing keyword research, strive to find the balance of search volume, search intent and keyword difficulty, but focus most on the intent and identify high-intent keywords.Be consistent. Create content on a regular basis, track its performance and optimize it and regularly update old posts.I never said content creation is easy, especially in such a competitive industry like SaaS. But I can guarantee all the effort you put in content marketing will pay off multiple times.If you need help with SaaS content marketing strategy or creating content,book a free calland let’s get you the results you want!Feel free to reach out to me onLinkedinif you have any questions.FAQWhat is a SaaS content marketing strategy?A SaaS content marketing strategy is a long-term plan for creating content that’s aligned with your goals to attract your target audience and convert them to paying customers.

Essentially, SaaS marketing is a way to introduce a product to the market, position the product, and build awareness for SaaS organizations.As a startup,SaaS content marketing strategieswill give you an edge over competitors. The reason is the awareness, usage, and implementation of SaaS strategies. According to a survey, around 63% of businesses do not have a documented content marketing strategy.

SaaS is similar to any other business. SaaS software is a product; that can be bought or sold. Support quality is one of the customers’ most important factors when choosing SaaS providers. Consequently, SaaS marketing is responsible for selling the product itself and the support that goes along with it. One sells only a product/service in a business, but marketing services and technology are crucial in SaaS.Why do SaaS companies have a different content marketing approach?Reasons SaaS companies prefer a different content marketing approach:The first reason is simple; SaaS companies are selling technology and service, requiring a different marketing approach.SaaS buyers are primarily digital users hence they checkout digital channels and reviews before buying.

A two-way approach is required for the same.Best SaaS Content Marketing Strategies for Your StartupIdentify Your Target AudienceAs experts at leadingdigital marketing companywill tell you that when developing a content marketing strategy for a SaaS company, the focus should be on reaching leads who aren’t already interested in the business, and that usually means producing educational content that can reach a relevant audience.You may create a checklist of some questions about your buyers to define your target audience. Examples: Buyer’s age & gender? Their monthly income? Is your buyer a consumer or a business itself? And more.Identify The TriggersAs soon as you identify your audience, you can identify the pain points that drive their purchasing decisions.The best way to identify the triggers of your market is to walk yourself through their experience and the steps they take to become customers.These trigger points will vary by audience, industry, and other variables.Set up campaign goals and decide what metrics you want to trackCampaign goals must be decided before executing any strategy. This gives us a clear picture of the path and makes us aware of any hurdles/difficulties.Also, it would be best if you look forward to specific marketing metrics like the average lifetime value of each unique visitor, percent of visitor who is new and returning, sign-ups per visitor, and more.Research For Appropriate KeywordsSEO can prove to be a game-changer for any SaaS business. Keywords are a crucial component of SEO. Hence proper research must be done before choosing appropriate keywords.Your content can be tailored to address your customers’ needs at each stage of their journey by identifying keyword terms that represent each stage.In addition to promoting more effective marketing and sales, this can also improve customer satisfaction and retention.Properly Analyze Your CompetitorsCompetitors are present in each field out there.

Although we haven’t created the content ourselves, we’ve picked up on what makes SaaS content marketing unique and challenging.What Makes SaaS Content Marketing Different?But is content marketing for SaaS really that different? Yes!

Identify the different avenues for your content marketing planAs part of your content marketing plan, you can come up with different types of content through which you promote your SaaS business. There are eight popular types of content that you can create for your customers.‍Blog postsEbooksVideosPodcastsSocial mediaCase studiesTemplatesInfographicsFor the sake of keeping things short, we’ll look at the 3 best content types that are worth incorporating in SaaS businesses.1. Blog PostsBlog posts are super important for SaaS businesses. If you haven’t noticed already, you’re reading a blog post yourself as we speak. Blog posts are posted on a website and you should regularly publish new content pieces in order to attract new visitors. Blog posts in the SaaS industry should offer valuable information. It should address the pain points of your visitors and offer valuable solutions. Blog posts should have an average length of 1,000 to 2,000 words.‍Why blogs are important for SaaS companies?Blog posts give companies a voice. It allows businesses to share ideas, share new products and services, and for discussing new industry trends. Blogging helps your customers understand your company’s vision.2. EbooksEbooks basically serve as lead generation tools for SaaS companies. Website visitors can download an eBook after submitting their contact information. Ebooks are long-form content and are published less frequently than blog posts.‍Why eBooks are important for SaaS companies?Ebooks serve as lead magnets to attract prospects in both the consideration and awareness phase of your customer’s buyer’s journey.3. VideosVideos are more engaging than blog posts. In addition to that, video content is shareable across websites and social media platforms. With that being said, videos require more time and investment to produce. However, video content offers high ROI so it is worth incorporating in your SaaS business.‍Why videos are important for SaaS companies?Using videos in your SaaS content marketing strategy is a great way of explaining the features and benefits of your software services. Video content also has a higher potential of grasping the attention of potential leads.2. Conduct your research for the topics you will coverTo figure out what topics you need to cover in your SaaS content marketing strategy, you need to first carry out in-depth keyword research and competitor analysis.To do this, you need the right research tools. Here are some of the most important tools that you can use for researching content topic ideas to cover:‍Ahrefs:A tool that can help you research the right keywords to target in your content. It can also help you study your competitors, audit the SEO of your website, and help you identify topics that are trending in your industry.Google Keyword Planner:A tool that can help you find related search phrases from your target search phrase. It can help you analyze the traffic a search phrase is generating, and tell you the competition and advertising cost of it.SEMrush:A similar tool to Ahrefs that can help you with keyword research and in-depth competitor analysis.You can use these tools to come up with a list of keywords around which you’ll come up with different topics that you’ll cover.3. Split the topics into informational and transactionalWhile the tools we talked about earlier are great for topic research and competitor analysis, they won’t help you understand the search intent of those queries that you short-listed to come up with the topic ideas to cover.‍Figuring out the search intent is your job. Not being able to determine the search intent of a keyword can negatively harm your content strategy.You must put yourself in your audiences’ shoes to figure out the intent behind each search term. Figuring the search intent of keywords will help you understand whether the keyword is informational or transactional in nature. This is where we introduce the concept of TOFU, MOFU, and BOFU content.TOFUTOFU means the “Top-of-the-funnel”. In this part of the funnel, search queries and keywords are informational in nature. For this phase, you should create content providing information that helps your readers learn more about the topic. You shouldn’t focus on selling your products or services in this phase. This phase is perfect for brand-building for pushing your primary topic.An example of a TOFU search phrase would be, “How do I make coffee?”. The searcher just wants information on the topic. They’re not necessarily looking to buy anything.MOFUMOFU means the “Middle of the funnel”. This is the intent stage of your customer’s buying journey and product discovery. At this stage of the funnel, searchers already have knowledge about the topic. They just want to know how your SaaS product or service stands out from the rest and how it can solve their problems.‍In this phase, you’ll need to drive a website visitor further down your sales funnel. To do that, you should cover topics such as guides, case studies, use cases, and other such content. Content topics covered in this phase will have a mix of both informational and transactional information. MOFU content sort of bridges the gap between the awareness and sales phase of your funnel.An example of a MOFU search phrase would be, “Miami hotel rooms”. The searcher is looking for information regarding hotel rooms in Miami and will possibly consider renting.BOFUBOFU means “Bottom of the funnel”. In this phase, searchers will use search queries with the intent to buy your SaaS product or service. For this stage of the funnel, you’ll cover keywords that people will use when they are in the final stage of their decision-making process.  An example of a BOFU search phrase would be, “best plagiarism checker” or “free plagiarism checker”. At this stage of the funnel, the searcher has made up their mind and is looking to make a purchase.4. Choose who will write and create content for your SaaSOnce you’ve got your keywords and topics sorted out, you should start producing keyword-oriented content. To make the content creation process easier, you must set up some production procedures. Your content production process should include:‍Develop a content calendarResearch topics to cover that are relevant to your target audienceHire content creatorsProofread and edit contentPublish or schedule contentFor each part of the content production process mentioned above, create a document. You can use project management platforms to collaborate and communicate with your content creation team. Teamwork Projects, ProofHub are just some of the many popular project management tools you can go for. When creating your content calendar, decide what type of content you want to cover and in what sequence. To attract a wider audience, consider creating a healthy mix of short and long-form content.‍When hiring content creators such as freelancers, in-house content producers, or content marketing agencies, you should consider recruiting freelancers who have knowledge about your industry. The reason why you should go with talented freelancers is that they’ll charge you less than content marketing agencies and you’ll save a lot on seating costs.‍When sharing your content requirements with your team, make sure to set a goal for each piece. What do you want to achieve with your content? Do you want to improve brand awareness, get more leads, or simply want to educate your target audience about your SaaS company? When creating your content requirements, research the pain points of your audience to ensure that your content addresses their issues.‍When scheduling content, you must make sure that you publish content frequently. You should focus on consistency. You must do some estimation to see how much content you’ll need to produce each month and then see how much content you can actually afford to produce with your team and resources.5. Focus on formatting the content effectivelyCreating content on a frequent basis is important for the success of Saas company’s online presence. Search engines give an edge to websites that publish new and up-to-date content on a frequent basis. That being said, while producing a lot of new content may not be that difficult, especially if you onboard freelancers but if your content is not formatted properly, your visitors will find it difficult to consume it.‍So now, we’ll focus on the concept of formatting content and how to do it properly. Here are some pointers that you should consider when formatting your content:1. Keep your content paragraphs shortShorter paragraphs make it easy to read and consume. People have short attention spans and short content makes it easy to retain information. So, make sure to break your content into smaller chunks by using subheads or even bulleted lists.2. Leave some white space in your contentDon’t cram too much content that can overwhelm your readers. People don’t want to endlessly read your content. So, keep your content short and add appropriate white space. The reason why you should add white space is that it creates an illusion that your content is shorter than it really is.3. Add visuals to your contentIn addition to breaking your content up, don’t forget to add visual images.Why images or visual content? Well, images not only increase the stay time of your visitors but visual aids are proven to improve learning by 400%. Visual content can also be processed 60,000 times faster than textual content.4. Make content scannableReaders don’t prefer reading the entire content piece to get the information they want. Most readers prefer skimming through the content to get relevant information. This is why you should consider making important phases and terms bold and don’t be afraid to use bullet points and underlines to make your content easily scannable.5. Keep your content shortAs humans, we can’t retain too much information at a time. This is why it is important to make your content short and to the point. This will make it easier for your reader to retain the information covered in your content.6. Provide valuable informationYou may choose to write short content, but if you omit to add relevant and useful information, your content won’t be able to rank on search engines like Google. Your content may consist of just 1000 words but it should offer useful well-researched information.6. Publish the contentCreating content is one thing, but promoting it is another. We would suggest following the 80/20 rule content production and promotion rule. When you spend 20% writing content, you should spend 80% of your time promoting it. Nowadays, getting a content piece to rank on Google is not easy. Back in the day, a 700 word that you write would get ranked on Google within a few hours. But with immense competition, that has become impossible.‍Google now only prefers ranking relevant and helpful content. You’ll need to put a lot of time and effort into content creation and promotion. So, once you create well-researched and structured content, you’ll want as many people to see it as possible.‍What’s the point of creating amazing content if no one even sees it? You may have written a great SEO-optimized content piece, you’d still need to promote it massively. Promoting a content piece can be easy if you know what to do. Here are a few ways you can promote your content.‍Make your content SEO friendly to get organic reachPromote your content through paid marketing channels like Facebook Ads or Google Ads.Market your content on social media platformsShare your content in relevant social groupsShare your content through email marketingShare content on forums like Reddit and QuoraReach out to other relevant websites to ask for backlinksYou’ll need to put a lot of effort into promoting your SaaS content.Bonus Saas Content Marketing TipThought we’d just leave you there?Let us share a bonus SaaS content marketing tip that we religiously use to help our clients.

They do just about everything and they do it RIGHT!What you will find on their website:‍BlogsWhitepapersCoursesPublications of (annual) surveysSocial media promotionAnd countless other resourcesOnce downloaded – you also have to provide a lot of information about yourself and your company.

The blogs are extremely valuable and very in-depth. No superficial open doors, but concrete tips at an expert level. What is striking is the large number of experts who like to write guest blogs for Moz. These heavyweights provide useful insights and share cases that even seasoned marketers can learn from. In addition, they have a clear beginner guide to content marketing where you are trained,  step by step in the world of SEO or content marketing.Tips For SaaS Content Marketing1. SEO for SaaS is very importantThe orientation phase is usually long and intensive for the target groups. Potential users google software solutions and then compare. Therefore, do extensive keyword research to see where the opportunities lie.  Brainstorm on which keywords you would like to be visible on. Think about which words potential customers Google when looking for your solution. Also, consider synonyms.Map search volumes and competition. This can be done, for example, with the help of the Google Ads Keyword Planner. (Action item: create a top 10 keywords list)Manually analyze your competition for the top 10 keywords. What are they doing well? Why do you think they are on page 1? What can you do better? Cluster keywords per subject and create specific pages and blogs for this.2. Multiple touchpointsBecause potential customers will intensively compare SaaS products, it is important that you create multiple touchpoints.‍Make sure you have an edge over the competition because the visitor has seen your brand and product a few times before via other channels. An example of a well-filled marketing funnel with multiple touchpoints:AnSEOblog that explains the problem and offers multiple solutions through useful information and use cases.Retargeting on social media.Be named in an overview blog (more on this later).Google search ad aimed at your competitor’s keyword.3. Out-of-the-box contentLook beyond just blogs. You see that large parties such as HubSpot use all kinds of content to fill the whole funnel. They offer courses, webinars, and downloads to bring you in. An example of creative content is a quiz or a calculator. One of the best tools for this isOutgroworInteract.4. Free trials & freemium modelFree Trials – SaaS can not do without a free version to try temporarily. With a free trial, you have the option to test the entire tool with all its functionalities for a limited duration – usually 14 or sometimes 30 days.‍A freemium model can be a good alternative. You can then use limited functionalities for an unlimited time. If you want all the features you will have to purchase a paid account.Both have advantages and disadvantages, but clearly offer this free option throughout your content marketing.5. Guest blogs and overviewsI found myself putting a lot of perceived value a SaaS brings by reading overview blogs that give their top X tools with a particular function. Many of these blogs are sponsored or work on an affiliate basis, which makes you wonder if their opinion is objective.‍However, as a marketer, I acknowledge that a SaaS tool that puts a lot of effort into its marketing is ready for growth and that usually also says something about the status and quality of the product itself.  Consciously, but sometimes also unconsciously: the more often I read positive reactions from bloggers, the better.Where can you make the most profit?In ‘regular’ content marketing for traditional products and services, the focus of the content is on the acquisition. This appears to be different from SaaS products. SaaS has the most profit in step Monetization, or converting trials to paying customers.‍With these insights, it helps to create special content for this specific step. This should be educational content in which the extra benefits of a paid account of your SaaS become clear.Nevertheless, content marketers of SaaS startups are mainly concerned with content for the first phase: Lead generation.ConclusionContent marketing for SaaS is in many ways different from the one-off sale of products or services. In the different phases of the customer journey, you need different forms of content.And even if you have convinced a customer of your product and you finally receive the first payments, the battle is not over yet.‍You have to keep the customer! So continue to offer added value by producing super valuable content in every phase of your buyer journey. And yes. Do create content that is for people who are already paid users of your SaaS because retention is very important.Manno NotermansManno is a wanderer of the world looking to make an impact and change the world for the better.

These actionable tips will help you create a  comprehensive content marketing strategy for your SaaS company22 mins read timeDeepshikha DhankharJan 13, 2023SaaS brands are known to be data-driven, and that’s certainly not a bad thing. But some brands get so caught up in the numbers that they neglect the story. Brand stories are told through content marketing, and for most brands, it works. In fact, brands using content marketing see around30% more growththan those that don’t.But content marketing for SaaS is a little different than the standard fare. Though it’s just as effective as content marketing for other industries and types of brands, there are certain considerations you’ll need to make as a SaaS brand.If you’re ready to jump headfirst intocontent marketingfor your SaaS brand, we’re here to catch you. And we’ve got all the guidance and tips you need to create a SaaS content marketing strategy that grows your brand…and kicks SaaS (SWWDT?).Read on to find out how to do it:What Is Content Marketing?First off, let’s start with a  definition of content marketing. In broad terms, content marketing uses the power of all types of content — blogs, downloadable assets, videos, podcasts, infographics,user-generated contentand more — to promote a brand.While you can use paid advertising todistributecertain pieces of content, on the whole, content marketing in an inbound marketing methodology, or organic marketing, means that your audience comes to you. Content is less about cold calls and paid ads and more about creating content that speaks to your audience’s needs, pain points, and desires and delivers information and solutions.While the content marketing process will look different for every brand, you can count on certain phases and milestones you’ll want to meet in your owncontent strategy.Wondering how you can create a SaaS cycle like this that will work for your SaaS brand? We’ve got you covered. But first, the $64,000 question:Is Content Marketing for SaaS Different from Traditional Content Marketing?In short, yes. Content marketing for SaaS is definitely not the same as traditional content marketing, though you will see some areas of crossover. But if you’re wondering how SaaS content marketing is different from its more traditional cousin, here’s the breakdown:SaaS is a product type that can span many industries and niches, so there’s no one-size-fits-all approach.SaaS brands are promoting an intangible product and the service they offer customers, so they have all the challenges of both tech brands and retail brands.SaaS can include both B2B and B2C products, which must be marketed differently.Content for SaaS audiences must balance engaging content with data and information.Reviews and referrals are critically important to SaaS brands, so content must drive those.You might be tempted to lean toward product-led marketing for your SaaS brand, but remember that SaaS customers are evaluating not just your product but your service and support, along with their own experience. Content marketing can tie all of those elements together and put your product in the spotlight while still giving consumers the content they need to engage and make a purchase decision.When it comes to marketing your SaaS brand, it all begins with a content marketing strategy.We’ll have more on building strategy a little later. But before we get into that, you probably want to see some examples of how successful SaaS brands are leveraging content marketing, right? We thought so.7 SaaS Content Marketing ExamplesWant to see how some of the biggest and best SaaS brands stay on top of their content game? We’ve got seven of the best right here:#1: HubSpotAny great SaaS content marketing list wouldn’t be complete withoutHubSpot, the brand that basically owns the whole concept. HubSpot offers a huge library of services and tools to brands and marketers across several hubs. While their products are paid (at certain levels), they also provide free resources, along with freemiums and trials.Everything available in their resource library is content. From ebooks to calculators, templates, and guides, HubSpot understands the power of inbound marketing and uses content as their cornerstone.#2: CanvaDesign platformCanvamakes amateurs feel like pros. But aside from a great product, they also offer valuable content that supports their brand. For example, Canva’s Design School is a repository of resources and interactive courses that get users engaged and interested in the product.As a SaaS brand, Canva understands putting its product front and center but also the importance of the user experience. Design School is just one of many initiatives created to do just that.#3: AhrefsSEO leaderAhrefsknows search — but they’ve also got a great handle on content. They offer many tools for marketers, and as a B2B SaaS brand, they clearly excel. The Ahrefs Academy offers an expansive library of video content that targets their audience at all stages of the funnel.Above, you can see a video tutorial on how to use Ahrefs — a top-of-the-funnel content piece for those just entering the awareness stage — along with an Ahrefs certification course for those at the bottom of the funnel ready to convert. This end-to-end funnel optimization sets their content apart.#4: HootsuiteSocial media management platformHootsuiteknows about more than just social content. They’re also experts in B2B SaaS, and they tailor their content marketing strategy around that expertise. They know B2B audiences love data and information, and they’re big fans of webinars.As you see above, they’re promoting a live webinar. A content piece like this drives urgency and creates a sense of FOMO. And though it’s not promoted here, those unable to attend the live webinar would likely be able to download a recorded version after the fact — maximizing the impact of this content asset and creating more opportunities to generate leads and engage with customers.#5: ShopifyShopifyis a B2B SaaS company that powers many B2C brands with their ecommerce platform. They’ve become a respected leader in their industry, which is largely due to their SaaS content marketing. Shopify has leveraged the power of podcasts by launching several of their own, targeting different buyer personas at different stages in the funnel.Shopify understands that podcasts are becoming increasingly more popular and are relatively easy to produce. Podcasts can get you a lot of bang for the buck, and they work to boost your brand’s reputation, trustworthiness, and position as a thought leader.#6: DriftDriftis a lead and demand generation platform that leans into AI to help you start conversations with your audience…and turn them into conversions. Drift has a ton of content across their website, and as a B2B SaaS brand, they focus pretty heavily on delivering information, facts, statistics, and data.One of the more robust sections of their website is their library of ebooks, whitepapers, and reports. These are in high demand for the B2B audience, and they’re a perfect way to do what Drift does best — bring in the leads.#7: MozAnother well-known SEO platform, Moz offers a bevy of tools that allows brands and SEO professionals to see real-time analytics and search performance — for their own website and those of their competitors. But the Moz blog is where they really shine when it comes to content.In fact, most top-performing SaaS brands have a blog that they update consistently. And while a blog can feel somewhat old-fashioned in the fast-paced marketing world, it’s a proven method of content marketing that drives results.How to Create a SaaS Content Marketing Strategy That Delivers ResultsNow that you’ve seen how some of the top SaaS are managing their content marketing efforts, you might be ready to give it a try yourself. But before you get to their level, you’ll need to develop a solid SaaS content marketing strategy. Here’s how to do it:Know Your Ideal BuyerYour ideal buyer is often referred to as your buyer persona. You might have more than one, but don’t get that confused with your target audience. A target audience is a broad way of reaching people whomightbe interested in your product. A buyer persona is a much narrower and more specific target that you develop using what you know about existing customers, those of your competitors, and who you think your product is right for.While target audiences look mainly at general demographics, buyer personas take into account demographic data but also psychographic details and behavioral attributes.Want to get started on your buyer persona?Download our free template!Understand Their NeedsNow that you have a better understanding of your buyer persona, you need to dive into the big question — what keeps them up at night? Remember that when you’re starting out, much of your content will focus on the consumers' needs, not necessarily on the solutions your product provides. That’s the fundamental basis for top of the funnel (TOFU) content.Make sure any content geared toward the awareness stage hones in on the user’s pain points and not as much on your solutions (you’ll get there later when you create more middle and bottom funnel — MOFU and BOFU — content).Embrace EmpathyOnce you’ve got an idea about what your buyer persona is losing sleep over — their pain points — you can create content that offers them higher value and moves them further down the funnel. But to do that, you need to be prepared to walk a mile in their shoes.Embracing empathy means you need to take a step back and see your brand as your buyer persona sees it. Consider what questions they’re asking at each stage of the buyer’s journey (Google’s People Also Ask questions are a good place to start), and then design content that answers those questions.This is a great opportunity to do even more research into your buyer persona and really engage with your ideal buyer. You can do that on social media or check out online forums like Reddit and Quora. These platforms put you in direct contact with the people you’re hoping to market to, so you can discover their wants and needs in a more casual way.Establish Goals and Metrics of SuccessContent can be a tricky area when it comes to measuring performance. Because you’ll be creating a lot of content at the TOFU/awareness stage, you may not always see your return reflected in revenue or sales. Content — much like SEO — is a long game and an investment for the long term. But there are some things you can measure to make sure your strategy is on track:Point of First ContactThink of this as the first impression you make on a potential customer. You can use gated content assets to acquire new leads and find out where those leads are coming from. In other words, you can track which piece of content moved them enough to give out their contact information. Knowing where their positive first impression occurred will help you create more content that gets results.Customer Acquisition CostsCustomer acquisition cost, or CAC, compares what you’re spending on marketing to the number of customers you acquire for that spend. The formula for CAC is as follows:CAC = MC (marketing costs) / CA (number of customers acquired)You may choose to look at the CAC of your entire marketing budget or break it down into siloes so you know which initiatives and strategies are most effective.Increase in Monthly VisitsKeep an eye on website traffic to understand if you’re getting more or fewer visitors after launching your content strategy. You can’t know if your content is driving new traffic, but you start to identify trends (e.g., your traffic goes up whenever you post a new blog).BacklinksBuilding a strong backlink profile is crucial to improving your search ranking and increasing your domain authority. And the good news: Content is one of the best ways to build backlinks. When you create content other people want to link to, you get a lift. Or you could create guest posts and content for other high-authority sites. Whatever your approach, you’ll want to closely monitor your backlinks as you launch your content marketing strategy.Free Trial RegistrationsThis is a big one for SaaS brands, many of which are built on the free trial or freemium models. Registrations for trials will likely come more from middle and bottom funnel content, so you’ll want to keep a close eye on those to ensure they’re driving users to sign up.Keyword RankingEvery piece of content you create should be optimized for search. That means you should have your priority keywords strategically placed throughout. For a lot of SaaS content, you’ll want to select lower-volume, high-intent keywords that drive conversions. They’re much easier to rank for, and they’re typically more effective than focusing on mega keywords that are highly competitive.Average Lifetime ValueNow that you know how much it costs to acquire a new customer, you’ve probably also realized that it’s more cost-effective to hang on to the customers you’ve got. So you’ll want to keep an eye on average lifetime value (LTV). The formula for calculating LTV is:CLTV = CV (customer value) x ACL (average customer lifespan)You can calculate LTV in two ways: either using past data to look at historic values or using predictive analytics via machine learning to anticipate the value.Demo RequestsIn addition to free trial registrations, you’ll also want to track requests for demos, as these are often very motivated buyers. You’ll want to make sure you’re tracking exactly where the requests come from, whether it’s via your blog, social media, or somewhere else, so you know exactly which piece of content is driving them.New vs. Returning VisitorsIncreased traffic is a great thing, but if they’re visiting your site and never coming back again, all the traffic in the world doesn’t really matter. Plan to keep tabs on how many visitors come back to your site. You can then determine why they’re jumping ship and create content that gives them a reason to stay on the site.Lead Conversion RateLead conversion rate or LCR measures how many conversions you’re getting for each visit to your website, whether those conversions are opting in to notifications, signing up for a mailing list, or downloading a piece of gated content. The formula for LCR is:LCR = C (conversions) / L (lead opportunities)LCR will be different based on what you’ve determined to be a conversion and how you define a lead opportunity.Conduct Competitor Analysis To Review What’s Working for Your CompetitorsIf you’re an established SaaS brand, you probably have a good handle on who your competitors are and what they’re doing to market their brand. But if you’re a newer SaaS brand or startup, or you simply haven’t checked in a while, you’ll want to audit the content your competition is distributing before you launch your own content marketing strategy.Check out their websites, read up on their blog, and go ahead and download a few gated assets so you get a good handle on what they’re prioritizing. Don’t forget to check out the content they’re promoting on social, and take a good look at how engaged their followers are. If you find high-quality content and plenty of interaction between the brand and the consumer, you’ve found a good blueprint for what you’ll need to do to compete.Map Keywords to Buyer’s JourneyTo make sure your site is ranking well — so all that great content you’re creating gets found — you’ll need to make sure your keywords are all mapped to the buyer’s journey and align withwhere your users are in the funnel. That means you’ll need to create content specifically for each stage in the journey.It’s tempting to focus most of your content at the top of the funnel because that’s where most leads come in. And more leads = more opportunity, right? Not always. Because TOFU content is so broad, you’ll get a lot of leads coming into the funnel to get the info they want and just as quickly falling out of it.If you choose keywords based on the top of the funnel, you will have a lot more competition, a harder time ranking, and minimal results. You shouldn’t neglect the top of the funnel, but don’t be afraid to focus a little more on the middle and bottom sections (the consideration and decision stages of the buyer’s journey). This is where the magic (i.e., conversion) happens.Choose MOFU and BOFU keywords by aiming for long-tail keywords that are low in volume and heavy on search intent because those are the ones that answer your buyer persona’s questions and give them the exact info they need to proceed down the funnel.Create Content That Achieves Your GoalsWhat are your content marketing goals? You might have many you want to achieve, whether it’s just getting more traffic to your site, generating new leads, or increasing conversions. There’s no “wrong” goal to choose when it comes to content marketing, but you do need to make sure that each goal you set is SMART:The goals you set will also help define which metrics are the most important in tracking your success.Create Content for Each Stage of the FunnelWhether you’re aiming to go wide with TOFU content or narrow down to motivated buyers with MOFU, you can’t ignore any stage of the funnel.Be aware of what your buyer persona is looking for at each stage, and make sure the content you’re creating fulfills their needs.Don’t forget to target your post-purchase audience as well. Content is a great motivator for getting repeat customers that refer their network, so this isn’t an area you can neglect.Establish a Process for Content CreationMost of the work you’ll do for your SaaS content marketing strategy will happen during the actual content creation. So you’ll want to have your process established early on. It’s important that your brand maintains a consistent publication schedule (more on that in a minute), so having a clearly outlined process will help ensure you’re always meeting deadlines. To find gaps in your content planning, you can use acontent matrixto plot out your strategy.The content creation process will look a bit different for individual brands, but you can expect it to include most of the following steps:Research trending topics within your industry and niche, and brainstorm content ideas that align with the funnel.Plan out content on a monthly/quarterly basis using an editorial calendar.Seek out talent to create the content, whether it’s freelance writers, an outsourced agency, or in-house team members.Edit all content for brand tone/voice consistently, grammatical errors, and alignment with your brand style guide.Schedule content and publish across distribution channels.Your process might include additional steps in between, but these will cover the basics you need to get started.Publishing TimelinePublishing irregularly will not deliver results. You don’t need to publish content every day, but you will need to establish a regular and consistent cadence for your content publication and distribution.SourceMost B2B brands publish content on a daily to weekly basis, with “multiple times per week” being the most common. Your schedule will vary based on the availability of resources and whether you have to find outside support to create your content. But the important thing is that the content publication happens regularly.Have a Plan for Earning TrafficYou don’t want to invest all this time and energy into creating killer content only to find that no one actually sees it. That means you need a plan for getting traffic to your site, your social platforms, and anywhere else you’re distributing your content.There are two reliable ways to increase your traffic:SEOSEO takes time. It’s a long-term investment in your brand, and it comes with some great ROI. SEO involves making sure your content is optimized with your selected keywords, but it’s more than that. You’ll also want to improve your site’s technical and on-page SEO by ensuring there’s no errors or issues that turn off visitors.SEO is an excellent partner to content, and they nearly always work better when used in conjunction.EmailIf you’ve spent time building a comprehensive email list, you’re already ahead of the curve. Email is a reliable way to get your content in front of the right audience because they’ve already opted-in to hear from you.Develop an Email List Building StrategySpeaking of email, it’s important that you build a solid list and put some energy into keeping it maintained. Clean it up regularly, eliminating duplicate addresses and managing unsubscribes.Then, create a strategy for distributing your content to your list. Look into segmenting it so the right content always gets to the right audience. Then create email campaigns highlighting your content, whether it’s a newsletter, product updates, lead magnets, or downloads.Create a Content Distribution StrategyWhen you’re putting together your SaaS content marketing strategy, you’ll go through several stages before you get tocontent distribution, which is one of the final steps in your content marketing journey.Where you distribute your content is almost as important as what you distribute. Not all content is created equal, and as you’ll likely be tailoring content to different buyer personas at different stages in the funnel, you can’t just expect to broadcast it to the entire world and call it good.Break down each piece of content by funnel stage, buyer persona, keywords, and strategic goals, then figure out which platforms will work best for distribution.Repurpose Published ContentThe best thing about content (in our humble opinion) is that it just gets better with time. If you’re creating relatively evergreen content, you should be able to update, repurpose, and reuse it for a longer period of time.In fact, older content that gets repurposed and redistributed on different channels usually delivers the best results:As you can see above, the key isn’t just updating the copy and not changing anything else — instead, you’ll want to change up the format (turning an infographic into a video, for example) and distribute it on a new channel.This is a cost-effective and efficient way to approach your content strategy. It will save you time and money in the long run and improve your outcome.Track Results and Adjust Based on DataEarlier, you laid out the most important metrics you want to track to make sure you’re heading toward achieving the goals you set. But how do you track all that data? Most of the tools you use will have some sort of analytics you can use, and some will offer the ability to create a custom dashboard so you can always keep tabs on important KPIs.Another way to track and use the data to your benefit is with A/B testing. Also called a split test, A/B testing is a valuable way to understand what your audience wants to see…and what they don’t.One important thing to keep in mind:Only test one element at a time, whether it’s a blog title, a CTA, or a webpage header. If you test more than one thing, you won’t know which is performing better and which is struggling.A/B testing will give you quick results, so you can adapt your strategy as needed. It's something moststartupsare very familiar with, but all businesses can learn from experimentation and testing. You should plan on a regular testing cycle throughout your content campaign so you’re constantly making improvements and finding the best variants for your audience.Embrace Automaton with SaaS Content Marketing ToolsThere are so many tools available to marketers and brands these days, and many of them provide a valuable solution that will help you create a SaaS content marketing strategy that works.

We bet they are wondering how to balance their advertising budgets as well as increase ROI. If you are curious also, let us introduce to you an effective way to market your product and acquire loyal customers.Meet His Majesty Content Marketing.Reasons to do content marketingAs we said before, one of the main reasons why companies turn to make content a part of their marketing strategy is the desire to optimize their marketing budgets. According to Neil Patel’s blog, content helps to decrease the costs spent on traditional marketing by62 percent.Quality content, accompanied by some SEO efforts and an email marketing strategy can bring you even more benefits.Communicate your values, and thus build brand awarenessGrow the list of leads you share with the Sales TeamBring targeted traffic to your websiteEncourage customer loyalty and build trust with your customersLet’s figure out the types of contentSaaS software developerscan benefit from.Types of content to create for SaaS companiesContent marketing is all about communicating with your audience. Here you are the one to choose the tone, decide on the topics, and find the ways to convey your message.Today, product software companies communicate with their customers in a number of ways, and content no longer refers to boring longreads and endless email sequences only.Content production for SaaS includes:Creating product landing pagesWriting expertise-based blog posts and case studiesCommunicating product updates and sending newslettersCreating product guides and presentationsPreparing webinars and product demosRecording videos and podcastsTo decide on the types of content that would be useful to your audiences, marketing professionals recommend sticking to theconversion funnel. Understanding the goals you’d like to achieve at different stages will help you target the right people at the right time.During the first two stages, your goal is to create awareness about your product and generate leads. Use blog posts and case studies to introduce the product to digital audiences. To help your potential customers understand which of their pain points your product is capable of addressing and explain the way to do that, run webinars and produce product guides. Build a presence on social media and wrap it up with some traditional email marketing.If you are doing right, and your leads are warm enough, your next goal is to explain why choosing your product is a win. At this stage, you’ll be targeting those who consider making a purchase with you. If pitching and haunting are not on your agenda, consider highlighting your strong points with product demos. Clearly communicate the price and help your leads compare the options. Offer free trial options to showcase loyalty.At some point, when the users stay with you for a while, you define the growth options that would be mutually beneficial. Offer to consult, communicate product updates in a personalized way, introduce training, and distribute special offers. This way you can turn customers into your brand advocates, improve the retention rate, and upsell.SaaS content marketing best practicesSo, how can you produce quality content of different formats and types and what makes a good marketing plan for SaaS?Make the most of the company blogA study by Business 2 Communityrevealedthat 98 percent of SaaS companies do blogging. On one hand, this fact underlines the importance of including a blog in your marketing plan for SaaS, while on the other, creates the demand for high-quality content to post on your blog.For SaaS companies, quality content possesses the following characteristics:Meets the interests of the target audience (for example, if the product is ascheduling toolfor project managers, explain why Scrum still rocks and give advice on time management)Introduces the product and its features (for example, if your product offers integration with a tool for online team communication, make sure you explain any bottlenecks and provide ways to handle them)Serves a single source of universal truth (for example, if you overview any recent updates a popular PM tool has just received, express your frank opinion and provide use cases)Showcases expertise (define your strong points, share the results you are proud of, ask for client testimonials)Contains a CTA (add interactive UI elements that reach users in the right places and encourage them to perform target actions)Make sure your blog is a clear reflection of your product and the values your product brings to the world.Invest in SEOThe key element of a SaaS content strategy is building and preserving your high position in organic search results. Here are the things you can do to improve your SEO rank:Generate meaningful content. Google’s latest updates put the reader first. This means you should be selective in choosing the topics you want to highlight and pay even more attention to the way you speak to your audience. Focus on one topic at a time, add facts from your own experience, and be helpful.Develop akeyword strategy. Build your SEO strategy around clusters of keywords that reflect your expertise. Find long tail keywords to optimize landing pages. Make deep research to find semantic keywords, and think of ways to adjust your strategy if you are losing your organic search positions. Use SEO tools and marketing SaaS solutions to make these processes easier.Measure performance. With the amounts of data produced and rolled out in the digital space, you need to keep an eye on your performance indicators. To automate this process, consider trying dedicated SaaS content marketing services. Regularly check if you are getting targeted traffic on your web pages and think of ways toimprove your SERP results.Don’t forget about backlinks.Quality backlinksare a vital part of your inbound marketing. Exchange links with subject-matter experts and do create content types that others would want to quote. Most often such content includes helpful articles, technical research, and informative landing pages. Check the backlinks of your competitors and monitor if yours are still in place to help you preserve a high rank in the SERP.Diversify your contentThe worst thing you can do is talk about an amazing product in a boring way. To make your content engaging, it needs to be useful and appeal to audiences with different perception types, as well as correspond to their lifestyles.To create meaningful case studies, e-books, and white papers use explanatory images and infographics. Where possible, apply storytelling and add client testimonials, as those communicate information in a natural and humanized way.Video content is also a good way to introduce your product and explain its use. According to theWyzowl Video Marketing Statistics report, 73 percent of potential buyers prefer watching a short product video to learn about its features and benefits.To provide potential users with more insights on product usage and reply to their questions, prepare presentations and invite them to the webinars. Once the live stream is over, upload the recording to your YouTube channel or place it on the website.Also, as of 2022, only18 percentof SaaS companies have launched their podcast. So, there is definitely room for yours. Invite subject-matter experts and discuss topics that are within your customers’ interests.Content marketing for SaaS: use casesSaaS products are many, but those who succeed with content marketing are few. Let’s overview some examples of SaaS products that managed to implement and preserve an outstanding content marketing strategy.ShopifyA well-known e-commerce platform for retail stores and marketplaces managed to turn its website into an all-in-one knowledge base for its customers. Their blog contains valuable insights on platform usage, sales, and marketing.Striving to satisfy the needs of their target audiences and diversify content production, Shopify launched two podcast series for entrepreneurs and about entrepreneurs.All the information on Shopify’s website is clearly categorized and presented in a user-friendly way. Their unique approach to content creation and strongmarketing expertisehelped them build a marketing image that’s easy to recognize and difficult to overlook.ZendeskZendesk is a SaaS platform for customer support and communication that’s used by 40.000 businesses worldwide. In their content, the software provider makes a strong focus on guidance, provides insights into customers' behavior, and explains how to provide the ultimate customer experience (CX).MailchimpThismarketing automation platformhas acquired a loyal audience using the power of storytelling. On their blog, Mailchimp extensively uses their clients’ success stories, distributes marketing materials, and provides educational resources for marketers.Their approach to content creation is way too far from being called ordinary. Apart from a number of podcast series, the brand has an in-house production studio for film creation.CanvaCanva, a popular design tool, puts a lot of effort into marking its blog educational for all user categories, from beginners to professionals. Their Design School resembles a real classroom, where students can evaluate the potential of the platform and learn a million of thighs it’s capable of.This approach allows customers to save time and assess the value they can get from the product in full before buying it.Final thoughtsContent is king. In the early stages of a company’s development, content marketing helps to clearly state the brand values and build trust with the audiences. Used in combination with SEO best practices, content is the one to create awareness and make your SaaS stand out from the competitors. It’s content that often helps potential customers make their purchase decisions, and it’s again content that’s embedded in the company's retention and growth strategy.SaaS giants like Shopify and Mailchimp use non-trivial content types like podcasts and videos that appeal to their loyal customers and help to acquire some new brand followers. You may start from basic things like improving your organic search results, crafting refined email sequences, and writing comprehensive product guides. Who knows, maybe soon your SaaS will be the one others are talking about as a success story.Daria Iaskovais a technology trends researcher and marketing content writer.

Xero’s Growth Strategy - How they acquired 350k users in the last 12 months - Webprofits BlogHomePortfolioPodcastInsightsMedia CentreNewsletterCareersContact UsBack to Homepage at Webprofits BlogXero’s Growth Strategy – How they acquired 350k users in the last 12 months20 Nov 2018|Tam Al-Saad - Get more articles like this sent to your emailhereXero is one of the darlings of the startup world.Partly because its platform has helped so many new businesses launch and succeed, but also because they’ve been there and done it themselves.Like many great businesses, Xero was founded when founder Rod Drury was having issues with his existing solution. Back in 2006, he felt that traditional desktop accounting software had become outdated and set out to create a cloud-based product.Fast forward to 2018 and Xero has more than 1.3 million subscribers and a market cap of approximately $6 billion.Despite scaling up to such a large user base globally, Xero shows no sign of slowing down with 351,000 subscribers added in the past 12 months. 30% growth for a business that already has a million subscribers is a fantastic result, so we wanted to figure out how they do it.I’ll start by giving an overview of how Xero has gotten to this stage, what their product is like, and how their website drives their growth. I’ll then introduce each member of our in-house growth team and allow them to break down what Xero are doing across their respective specialisms.Growth HistoryThe ProductThe WebsiteEmail MarketingPaid SearchOrganic SearchContent MarketingSocial MediaCommunity MarketingEvent MarketingYouTubeHistory of growthPartnersXero are in a really interesting market.Though their end users (customers) are small business owners, many of these people have their business finances managed by an accountant or bookkeeper. As a result, promoting their product directly to the end user wasn’t the most effective way to grow fast.Early on in their timeline, Xero understood that if it could reach accountants and bookkeepers, and have them buy into the value of their product, then Xero could accelerate its growth and bring in the revenue to help them grow elsewhere.It’s an approach that they execute very well by providing an extensivepartner program. As well as doing what it can to help their partners generate more clients, Xero offers exclusive events and even awards to provide as much value to their partners as possible.Their investor briefing back in September 2016 highlighted the strength of this approach, pointing out that more than 90% of their paid subscriptions in Australia & New Zealand (their most developed markets) came from accounting partners.Though this undoubtedly is a factor in their success, this article will focus more on the marketing they do directly to small businesses.“What gets measured gets managed”One thing that is clear from reading Xero’s financial reports is that they are big on recording and improving metrics. Though this shouldn’t be a surprise given the business started out as an accounting software, it’s something that we see a lot of companies neglect.As a SaaS business, there are probably thousands of metrics that Xero could track, buttheir annual reportsshow these metrics distilled into a small handful that actually make a difference when it comes to business growth.In my opinion, it’s impossible to achieve sustainable, significant growth if you don’t have a solid understanding of what metrics determine the success of your business, and are able to track and improve those numbers on an ongoing basis.As you can see from their definition of Annualised Monthly Recurring Revenue, Xero are not afraid to change the metrics they use to define success as their business changes.BONUS:Looking to level up your approach to digital marketing?Click hereto learn more about our Fluid Marketing service, a collaborative and relentless approach to growth.The ProductXero came to the forefront as a cloud-based solution, and that helped to disrupt and revolutionise the accounting industry, but they needed (and still need) a lot more than that in order to stand out from their competitors and grow.In this section, I’ll be outlining what the marketing is actually selling and how it fits into how the company positions itself.An award-winning productGreat marketing would fall flat on its face if the product is no good, and Xero’s product is exceptional whichever way you measure it.Source:Canstar BlueIn fact, for the last four years in a row, Xero have come out on top when Canstar Blue have compared different accounting platforms. Xero, of course, uses these awards as selling points across its website and marketing, but we’ll come to that later.One of the reasons Xero is so popular with customers is the number of integrations it has. Xero seamlessly integrates with thousands of banks in the countries it operates to bring in data in real time. They also focused on building integrations with other software companies so that relevant data can be shared securely, automating processes and saving businesses time.Beautiful BusinessThough Xero started out as an accounting platform, it has sinceevolved into a small business platformwith a new tagline to match – “Beautiful business”.This shift outlines to me one of Xero’s biggest strengths: their commitment to putting the needs of the customer first.Having achieved so much as an accounting platform for small businesses, it would have been easy for Xero to widen their reach and start looking at applying those solutions to enterprise level businesses and go after significantly larger average values.Instead, Xero recognised the value of their product, and their customers, and decided to expand the product into providing even more value to their target audience – small businesses.This dedication to helping small business is evident throughout their website and marketing (which we’ll be delving into later in this article). In fact, having a strong tagline can be an asset across a business. It’s something that anyone in the company can refer to in order to help guide them in their work, at any point they can stop and think “How does this align with the business goals/values?”You’ll see throughout this article how Xero really focus their messaging and imagery across their website and marketing on small businesses. By doing this, they’re making the brand and product more relatable to their target audience, increasing the chance of converting and keeping them as a customer.A further example of their commitment to the customer is thefeature request sectionof their community site.This is a prime example of what people mean when they refer to a customer-centric approach, and Xero does itverywell.The websiteOk, now we’ve taken a look at who Xero are and what they do, let’s start looking at how they actually promote and market themselves.We’ve said it time and time again that without a good website, a company will always struggle with their digital marketing. It’s the storefront of the 21st century and having it set up correctly could make or break your business growth, so it’s worth the time and effort to get it right.Xero’s website is pretty large so I’m obviously not going to break down every single page, but I will look at a couple of key ones that most companies will have, especially SaaS businesses.The homepageXero have a textbook SaaS home page in my opinion, and I’ll be breaking it down element by element to highlight exactly what they’re doing.Above the foldLet’s focus on the most important bits first – everything above the fold.HeadlinesOn its own, I think the headline is actually a bit weak but it works brilliantly in conjunction with the subheadline, and it brings in their “beautiful business” tagline.Together, the headline and subheadline succinctly explain what Xero does, who it’s for, and what the benefit is to the end user. It outlines how all-encompassing the platform is without outlining each individual feature, and points out that using Xero allows small businesses to do what they do best – focus on their business.ButtonsNext, let’s take a look at the call-to-action (CTA) buttons. Firstly, they stick out like a sore thumb, which is exactly what you want them to do. The green contrasts really well against the darker backgrounds that they sit on, and so the eyes dart to them right away.Then there’s the wording of the CTA itself – “Try Xero for free” and “Free trial”. It’s a low commitment action that I would probably want to do if I was interested in becoming a customer of Xero. And if you’re visiting Xero for the first time, you might consider learning more by actually signing up.If you already know about Xero and have been thinking about signing up, then the CTA is also exactly what you came to the site to do.More importantly, it’s concise and direct in that I know exactly what will happen if I do click that button. I’ll be signing up to Xero, and I won’t need to pay. Simple, but effective.I also want to talk briefly about the buttons beside the green ones. I like to call these “ghost buttons” in that they are buttons but don’t stand out beside the brightly coloured ones. These give users an alternative navigation route if they’re not ready to purchase, or already have. That keeps them on the site until they find what they want – nice!BONUS:Looking to supercharge website leads or sales?Request a Website Auditand our team of experienced consultants will prepare a detailed report outlining what levers you need to pull to drive more high-value customers.The imageWebsite images should be selected with purpose; they should always relate to the copy/topic around them somehow, and I think this image does a great job.It shows someone (presumably a business owner) working on their business. It would have been easy to show the platform itself and highlight the features, but instead it highlights the benefit of using Xero – the fact that you can focus on what you do best. It’s also just one guy on his own, which is what it must feel like for a lot of small business owners.The job itself and the setting are also interesting – I think it highlights that Xero customers come from all different kinds of professional backgrounds and industries. Therefore, Xero as a platform is applicable to all sorts of backgrounds and industries; it’s about doing beautiful business.The navigationIf the headings and buttons don’t immediately give you what you want, you should be able to find it in the navigation bar. The headings in the bar relate really well to what you would like people to do: Find out more about what your product does, find out why it’s right for them, see how much it costs, get someone to help them with your product, support their business, or more info if you’re a partner and not a customer.The choice of a white background also helps it to stand out but not overwhelm the page so that the buttons are still the focal point.The rest of the homepageSo, someone has landed on the site and hasn’t immediately found what they want – that’s to be expected. What happens next?Canstar Blue awardWell, the first thing they point out is their award wins (which I referred to earlier). This is an awesome place to put the Canstar Blue award info; it lets the user know right away that other people rate the platform highly, and that gets buy in for the rest of their visit.Customer storiesAlong that same theme, the next section is more social proof in the form of customer stories with a header that boasts how many users they have. If “over 1 million subscribers love Xero” then it’s got to be pretty good, right, but the videos themselves are also a great asset.They’re only 2 mins long, they highlight what people love about being an entrepreneur, the problems they had with accounting, and then their opinion on Xero. They’re concise, they’re relatable, and they’re very positive about Xero – exactly what you want in a testimonial.The fact that they’re also videos is a bonus point. People get tired of reading sometimes, and it’s good to have information displayed in a few different formats to keep people engaged.FeaturesNotice that it’s only after the website focuses on the (potential) customer and what’s in it for them that Xero start to talk about what the platform does in detail.The features section is clearly laid out and easy to navigate around. Each feature headline makes it clear what you can do, and then the accompanying copy elaborates a bit more.I also really like the language used in this section. Not once do they say something like “Xero does..” or “we can..”. It’s all aboutyouand whatyoucan do.If you want to find out more about any particular feature you can click to learn more, but you can also watch a short video overview if you’d rather consume the info that way. The best part of the video overview is that it doesn’t navigate you away from the page, which allows you to come back and watch an overview on the next section when you’re done. Brilliant.PricingXero don’t go into a lot of detail here and I think that’s fine. If people are still scrolling around then it’s likely that they aren’t ready to talk about pricing yet, but they do provide enough information to allow the user to make a quick decision around whether it’s affordable.The decision on whether it’s worth it or not requires a lot more information, and for that you need to click through to see full details.I would personally like to see a little bit more information about what distinguishes between the different price points on this page – maybe just the biggest points with a CTA to click to read more. Having said that, I think it does a good job.Web FormFinally, we come to the all-important web form.The header “30 day free trial” and accompanying sub header do a great job of telling the user what happens when they fill this form in. It also tells them what they don’t need to do – add credit card details. For many SaaS customers, adding credit card details for a free trial is a frustrating stumbling block, as a lot of them worry about being tied in or forgetting to cancel.I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer on whether you should collect card details for a free trial, you would need to look at your own data in terms of acquisition and activation rates to decide if you should charge for a trial or not. But you’re likely to end up with happier customers (or at least fewer unhappy ones) if money doesn’t suddenly start coming out of their account a month down the line. (Check out this articleif you want help deciding)Beyond that, it’s a pretty simple and standard web form. Nothing distracts from the details being added, and they don’t ask for too much information given it’s a free trial. I would argue whether or not they need to collect a phone number at this stage, but I would assume it is so a sales team can follow up to support the trial and provide assistance if needs be, in order to turn them into a fully fledged customer.All in all, this is a great home page. It has all of the elements you need to make a good impression, keep someone on your site, or get them to convert.Features pageThough the home page touched on some of the features,Xero has a pagewhere they outline a lot more about what their platform is capable of. It’s worth pointing out too that the navigation bar extends out to help you get to the features you’re most interested in even quicker.Now for the page itself.Above the fold it looks a lot like the Home page does. The layout is the same, as is the headline, sub headline and button placement. Let’s break it down like we did the home page.HeadlinesThe main header here is a lot more direct than the one on the home page. The user has shown interest in the features of the platform and so Xero’s message is one that sums up the features. This headline stands alone really well, but is supported by the subheadline very well too.Together they once again outline what Xero does, who it’s for, and what the benefits are. This time, rather than focus on the benefit of letting you run the business, it highlights the benefit that it makes numbers effortless.ButtonsThe button placement and colour are the same as on the home page, so not much to highlight that is different – even the CTAs are the same. This consistency from the previous page means there’s no doubting what the next step is if you want to go ahead and use Xero.The one thing that does differ is the ghost button. Rather than a generic “learn more”, Xero directly guides you towards the different plans and pricing options, which would be the logical next step.ImageRemember how an image of the software was the wrong thing to go with on the home page? Well, it’s a great option for the features page. Someone on the features page wants to know more about what the software does so it’s a good idea to actually show it to them.The image itself is great too.Firstly they’re showing you that they have mobile and tablet versions of the platform without having to spell it out as a feature, which is pretty cool.However, I think the really clever part is what’s on the screens. It’s a clear layout, not too much being displayed and it’s got clear colours. It looks like a simple accounting software for small businesses, exactly what it says in the headline.The featuresNow we get into the features themselves.Though every feature listed on the home page is visible, the wording used is different. Let’s take the Payroll feature as an example.On the home page the mini header was “pay your employees”, and the copy said “Calculate the payroll, pay employees and manage payroll taxes.”On the features page the header was “payroll” and the copy said “Pay staff, send payslips and run reports with simple small business payroll software.”The change in language here reflects the change in the users’ intention. When scrolling the home page they are still learning about what the benefits of Xero are whereas on the features page they need to know what it can do. It’s a subtle distinction but one that Xero understands and adapts for very well, in my opinion.The other interesting part is the image they use to visualise the features. It made sense to use icons on the home page to keep it simple, but by using mock ups of the features on this page it gives the user more insight into what the feature does. Another subtle but clever change.24/7 SupportXero has not only saved the best feature for last, they’ve also nailed how they promote it.Small businesses owners are often not technical, and certainly not accountants (except for people who own small accounting firms). There’s nothing worse than not being able to work out how a software works when it’s critical to your business, and many entrepreneurs have spent countless frustrating hours trying to work things out.Having support available 24 hours a day takes away the concern that the platform will be difficult to use and means that the user knows they won’t be struggling for hours if something goes wrong or they can’t figure out how it works. Just another example of Xero’s customer centric approach.Now let’s look at the mini header – “Never be put on hold again”.I’m sure every person reading this has been put on hold for a service at some point in their lifetime if not their career. Don’t you just hate it? This header perfectly signifies the benefit of 24/7 support and I love it.What isn’t on the pageAs great as this page is, I think it’s missing something…Social proof!Yes, the home page had plenty of it, but what if someone didn’t scroll down on the home page or clicked straight through? What if they clicked through the organic sitelink after searching for the brand?You’re counting on someone having already seen it somewhere else, but there is no harm in having something on here that shows not only are there loads of features, but that other people think those features are actually useful.A company of Xero’s size must have an array of testimonials and case studies, and I’m sure they could have picked one where the customer was singing the praises of the features alone.Surprising.Pricing pageNow we come onto the pricing page, arguably the second most important stand-alone page (after the home page) for any SaaS business (and most other businesses who display a price online).Above the fold, Xero has kept it really simple. There’s no need for creative imagery, clever headlines, or bright calls to action. The intent of the user visiting this page is to find out how much it costs, so you should give them that information.PricingI don’t love how Xero has displayed the different options here – there’s an awful lot of text on the screen at one time and it’s hard to differentiate between the different packages.Unlike on the home page, Xero hasn’t outlined that the middle option is the most popular. OK, it’s not the most creative approach to CRO (conversion rate optimisation) but you want the potential “average” customer to know what the “average” customer buys. It just helps speed up the decision making process.The cheapest option has more text in bold than either of the other two options, making it slightly more noticeable. Maybe it’s a good thing that the eye sees how limited the options are, but I’d rather the user looks to the right as much as possible.And then we get onto the optional extras …Where the main details of the features available at each price point are clear, concise and take up a line each, the optional extras are a mess of paragraphs. Yes, they’re not easy points to get across, but there are cleaner ways to do it.For example, rather than have all of the info on the page at one time, why not have a bit of the details on the page and then a little icon (maybe a question mark) which displays more when you hover over it? At the moment the extras overshadow the main elementsandthey push the call to action buttons below the screen.The call to action buttons are great, giving the user the option to purchase straight away or go into a trial – but with the main button being to purchase. This should help people who have made up their mind skip ahead and get straight into paying, but allow those who are still unsure to play around first.If a user can skip a part of your funnel and not have their journey disrupted then it’s fine for them to do that.The features againOutlining the features once again on this page is a great move. It’s a confirmation that no matter what price you pay you get access to all the features that made you wonder how much it costs in the first place.But it also serves as a reminder of exactly what you get when you pay for Xero. And it’s very handy for anyone who may have skipped ahead without looking at the features.Notice how there are no links to elsewhere on the site from the content on this page? That’s because when a user gets to the stage of the funnel where they’re looking at price, you want them to hit purchase or trial and not really anything else.What’s missing?They’ve done it again – no social proof!Pricing is usually the final step before a user converts, and having testimonials is a really simple addition that could help them get the end user over the line.Website overviewThis isn’t a comprehensive review of their site by any means, but it should give you some insights into what a good SaaS website should look like.In my opinion, Xero’s website looks great on the face of it, but when you dig a little deeper there are definitely improvements that could be made to help them step it up a notch or two and help convert more customers into trials.Email MarketingThe primary function of email marketing in Xero’s marketing mix is to convert users on a free trial to paid subscriptions. This is where we start to move away from acquisition and instead start to look at activation.And because this step sits right before Xero generates revenue, it’s important.Many businesses fall into the trap of obsessing over acquisition at the expense of activation. Businesses need to be constantly working to improve their activation rate, as the activation rate is a key determinant of what is the maximum you can afford to acquire new customers.So, Xero might be getting therightpeople to register for a free trial, but how do they get them to engage with their product and convert to a paid subscription?That’s where Xero’s onboarding sequence comes in…This is what I was able to map out based on my experience and engagement with Xero’s platform:Some examples of the above emails are included belowNote, Xero are usingMarketofor their email marketing, which you can normally work out from the email sender information:Xero’s onboarding sequence is adaptive to how users are engaging with the product, using different triggers to ensure the email journey is reflective of what steps users have taken to get Xero setup with their business.For example, Emails 2, 3 and 4 acknowledge that the user hasn’t engaged with their free trial yet and directs users to their support site to get answers or help from the Xero team. If the userhasengaged with the product, these emails do not send (we cross-checked these emails across two different users, one who engaged with the product, one who did not).As users approach the end of the 30 day trial (assuming they still haven’t become a paying customer) Xero offers the user a discount on their first 4 months of use in order to close the sale. Once the user’s trial ends, a more aggressive discount is offered to the user (again assuming the user hasn’t already converted to a paid subscription). To drive urgency, both of these offers use time-based scarcity, expiring just 4-5 days after the users are notified of the offer.What’s most important to note about Xero’s onboarding sequence – and not enough businesses do this – is that their messaging explicitly reflects the activation stage of the funnel.Once users have demonstrated interest in the product by registering for the free trial, Xero focuses exclusively on getting users to start using the product. For example, based on my user behaviour, Xero’s sequence spoke to specific steps such as connecting my bank account or contacting their support because I wasn’t engaging with the product.What’s important to note here is that Xero’s messaging is very different at the acquisition stage (Facebook ads, landing pages, XeroCon) versus the activation stage (their onboarding sequence).Xero’s approach to acquisition marketing places emphasis on specific customer case studies (emotional response) and results/outcomes (logical response) but, once users have signed up for a free trial, speaking to case studies and results is no longer as effective as these users are likely alreadyproduct and solution aware.These are the key friction points Xero needs to address with their onboarding sequence:Time – How much time will it take to set up or migrate from an existing accounting solution? Will Xero save me time on a daily basis?Ease of use – Is Xero going to make my life easier?Cost – Is Xero cost effective for our business?Xero’s onboarding sequence definitely speak to potential time savings and ease of use at each step of the journey:Xero’s promotional emails at the conclusion of the free trial also aim to minimise the cost friction by easing users into a paid subscription with a discount:All marketing (and product) efforts for users in the activation stage should be focused on removing any friction that may prevent the user from digging in and engaging with the product’s sticky features.In terms of minimising user friction at the activation stage, Xero does this well.Where to from here?To convert more trial users to paid customers, an approach Xero could split-test against their existing sequence is explicitly structuring their onboarding journey as a guide to ‘Getting up to Xero-speed’,leveraging more of their training videosand testing higher email frequency.These emails don’t have to get into the details. Instead, each email could have animated video calls-to-action that link users directly to the relevant training video. Xero should ensure that each email links how the various features save time and money and makes small business finance easier.Each email could also contain a ‘trigger link’ that allows users to trigger the delivery of the next email immediately if they so wish. This would allow users who wish to get set up more quickly accelerate their activation.This iteration could be tested against the control as a split test in Marketo, identifying paid conversions as the main success metric. Once results are statistically significant, the losing sequence should be retired.Depending on the prioritisation of marketing activities in the pipeline and internal resources, a new split test could be prepared and executed based on prior learnings.Paid SearchLike most companies that are proficient at paid search, Xero is using a combination of different landing pages to cater to prospective customers at each stage of the conversion funnel.Although we cannot account forallcampaigns, keywords and ads Xero are actively running, nor can we uncover how Xero are structuring their ad accounts, we can draw insights from Semrush by classifying the keywords, ad copy and landing pages recorded.From this approach, we can infer that Xero has likely run the following key campaigns over the last two years:Branded campaign – bidding on terms that contain‘Xero’.Competitor campaign – bidding on terms that contain competitor keywords such asmyob support,myob payslipandintuit quickbooks;Terms that pertain to features or use cases – terms such aselectronic invoice template,quote template;Terms that define what Xero’s platform does – terms such asinventory management system,bookkeeping softwareandbest small business accounting software.The above links correspond to landing pages that Xero have used in conjunction with these search terms on Google Ads.Let’s jump into some of these campaigns …Branded TermsXero is bidding on terms that contain their brand name because these top positions in the search results are targeted by their competitors, including MYOB and Quickbooks, and it’s important that Xero retain their presence when it comes to branded search terms.Interestingly, Xero is sending paid traffic from branded search terms to theirAccounting Software landing page, and not their homepage. This isn’t always the case, even for businesses who are heavily dependent on conversion-oriented landing pages for paid search. Instead, many businesses choose to send branded traffic to their homepage in case they are existing customers, and because for this audience, the search intent is relatively unknown so they choose to facilitate greater website navigation.However, for paid search, I’m always an advocate that conversion-oriented landing pages are essential to getting the most out of your ad spend.What’s puzzling about Xero’s branded ads is that although the Ad URL for the headline sends visitors to theirAccounting Software landing page, their Sitelinks (Payroll,Pricing,Xero™ Accounting SoftwareandTrial for Free) are not directing users to conversion-oriented landing pages, even though they have suitable landing pages with reduced navigation that they could use for each of these Sitelinks.As a note, although the name ‘Sitelinks’ implies different pages on the website, you can certainly use Sitelinks to direct users to conversion-oriented landing pages and you don’t even need to use varied landing pages for each Sitelink. Instead, all four Sitelinks can direct users to the same landing page, in which case it works effectively to use each Sitelink to illuminate a different USP. This can be very effective for maximising your return on ad spend by ensuring you are prioritising your best-performing pages, and are not directing paid visitors to lesser performing pages on your website.Although Xero is bidding on branded terms such as ‘Xero’ or ‘Xero HQ’, they appear to have negatedsomephrases such as ‘Xero Login’ and ‘Xero support’.Xero could definitely go further with their management of negative keywords, as their ads are triggered for phrases like ‘Xero shares’ and ‘Xero market cap’. This is likely a poor use of ad spend and not suitable placements for customer acquisition-focused ads:Competitor TermsAt the moment, it would appear from data in Semrush that the largest proportion of Xero’s paid search budget has been allocated to bidding on phrases containing competitors such as MYOB and Quickbooks. To support this strategy, Xero uses competitor landing pages coupled with ad copy that invites users to change to Xero.With top of page bids for competitor terms such as ‘Quickbooks’ or ‘MYOB Accounting’ as much as $20 per click, it’s important that their landing pages use direct response copy to ensure that the messaging strongly resonates with the user.While Xero’s landing pagedoeseffectively communicate that the switch to Xero is easy and addresses key features and benefits, Xerodoes notprovide any direct comparison. The only reference to Quickbooks in the above landing page is the discrete reference to this competitor in the subheadline. This is absolutely a missed opportunity and definitely something I’d be looking to test further.Especially as their competitors don’t mind playing hardball…Note, we’ve had clients who have had their competitors reference their brand name in ad copy, and we’ve reached a resolution by sending a cease and desist letter.So, what’s a SaaS business doing this better?Check out how Ontraport have prepared comparison landing pages to target search terms pertaining to their competitors:Active Campaign,Get Response,HubspotandMailchimp.For each of their key competitors, Ontraport outline how their product stacks up against the competition, showcasing which features have been overlooked by their competitors. I love Hubspot, but it’s hard not to take an interest in Ontraport with a feature table like the following:Ontraport uses each of these landing pages in conjunction with Google Ads campaigns that target terms like ‘get response’ or ‘active campaign alternatives’.But back to Xero.By taking a similar comparison approach, Xero can ensure that regardless of whether the user is a customer of one of their competitors, or isn’t yet using online accounting software, that they assert why Xero is the best solution on the market through strong supporting evidence, such as Canstar’s comparison:Source:Canstar BlueTo get the most out of this strategy, Xero should definitely continue to target search terms that contain competitor names, such as ‘myob alternatives’ or ‘quickbooks reviews’, but could also target phrases like ‘MYOB Support’ and ‘MYOB Help’ to reach their competitors’ customers when they’re dissatisfied or losing their patience.BONUS:Click hereto learn more about our Paid Traffic Audit. Our team of experienced consultants crunch the numbers, analyse the data and dig into the results of your Google Ads account to ensure your money is being spent wisely.Invoice Template TermsOne of the more interesting campaigns Xero have tested is targeting search terms such as ‘electronic invoice template’ and ‘tax invoice template ato’, and directing people to a landing page that speaks to how Xero’s platform can address their invoicing needs.It’s likely that Xero identified there was adequate search volume around terms pertaining to invoice templates and that these terms may be less competitive than more commercial search terms like ‘accounting software’. Notably, this campaign reaches people who may not actively be looking for accounting software but may see how Xero’s templates could be saving them time and sign up for the free 30 day trial.However, this type of approach is more top of funnel, with most users likely being at an awareness or consideration phase. This means that an effective onboarding sequence is likely essential to convert this audience into paid subscribers, as these are presumably less qualified leads because their search intent does not directly pertain to accounting software.Xero should also be tailoring their onboarding sequence and in-app messaging so that it places greater emphasis on Xero’s invoicing features, as we know that invoicing was the initial need that triggered the user looking at Xero as a solution for their business.Website vs Landing PagesWith the exception of Sitelink extensions, Xero is using conversion-oriented landing pages for paid search, instead of directing people to their homepage or product feature pages.It’s worth noting that Xero is actively using 10 or so key landing pages, many of which have gone through multiple iterations, such as the two following pages:https://www.xero.com/au/try/payslips/https://www.xero.com/au/try/payslips-2/In Xero’s revision of this landing page, they have made 6 key changes:1. Hero sectionSelected a person-focused image, instead of an image of the product’s interface.Revision:Original:2. Menu barThe menu bar is no longer sticky and has fewer links to internal pages.Revision:Original:3. Removing some of the emphasis on featuresXero removed the “Make life simple with payroll” and the “Want to know more?” sections.These details are likely more suitable at the activation stage than at an acquisition stage (discussed in greater detail in the email marketing section of this growth study).4. Customer storiesIncluding multiple customer success stories instead of one big video section – it would also be worthwhile to include a logo for each of these businesses in the preview so users can more easily find customer stories that resonate with them.Revision:Original:5. Pricing plansXero removed the pricing plan section, so the landing page no longer speaks to how much Xero will cost. While pricing is likely less of a consideration for enterprise customers, it’s certainly a constraint for small businesses, so I would be interested to know how this change has impacted performance.Certainly, what’s missing from their original landing page is an explanation of how these plans differ. Displaying multiple pricing tiers without an explanation of what’s included in each package would cause me to leave the page to Google this, and that defeats the point of a well-executed landing page.Here’s a great resource on somebest practices for SaaS pricing pages– there are a lot of considerations when it comes to pricing tables.6. Final call-to-action sectionXero removed the final call-to-action – not having a call-to-action towards the end of the page conflicts with conversion rate principles. I would hope they have some data to suggest this is optimal.Revision:Original:Key Takeaway:At face value from a conversion rate optimisation perspective, some of Xero’s updates make sense, some do not. Hopefully, in the instances where these updates do not follow typical conversion principles, Xero has insights that draw from how people are engaging with their web content, landing pages or product that provide an explanation for why Xero has made certain revisions.Organic SearchAccounting software is a big market, with multiple players clawing for their target audiences’ attention. There’s a lot of noise online, making it harder for brands to reach consumers. And it’s not simply enough to have a good product, good ad campaigns or to create compelling content – you must be able to get noticed.Search engine optimisation (SEO) is one of the ways Xero has been able to increase their discoverability and lead more potential customers to their platform.Xero has shown that by targeting the right keywords, optimising their pages and creating exceptional content campaigns optimised for search, it is possible to move your brand forward with the right messages that engage the right audiences.I’ll break down their approach, analyse their search and content marketing strategy, and offer some key takeaways. Let’s begin…KeywordsWith so much search volume and competition on Google for accounting and bookkeeping-related keywords, an investment in top organic rankings is well worth the time (for we all know that SEO is a long-term strategy) and energy.Xero has invested heavily in creating a robust SEO strategy to drive growth and outrank their competitors for top, high volume search terms across their primary shores (Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the US).For the sake of this study, I’ll be looking at what they’re doing in Australia.Their approach to keyword rankings can be categorised similarly to their paid search approach:Branded –ranking for phrases that contain ‘Xero’Product/service terms –ranking for phrases that describe their key service offering including “small business accounting software”, “inventory management software”, and “payroll”.Partnerships –ranking for phrases that contain branded partners includingDeputy,Microsoft Power BIandHR Block.Competitors –ranking for phrases that contain direct competitors includingMYOB,Reckon, andQuickbooks.Non-branded terms –short and long-tail queries that target keywords related to small business finance such as “best inventory management system for small business”, “can a small business get a tax refund” and “invoice template”.The above links correspond to ranked optimised pages that Xero have used in conjunction with these search terms.Here are the full reports that show you how they’re ranking on Desktop and Mobile.Let’s take a closer look at some of these keywords…Prime real-estate – the top 5 positionsXero drives a large amount of organic traffic to their website from branded terms, holding the top 5 organic search positions for nearly 1500 keywords containing their brand name.In fact, according to estimates from SEMrush, the term “xero” drives 52.78% of their organic site traffic to theirhomepage.But, for now, we’re going to exclude branded terms to see where Xero has been able to drive traffic and organic growth to their site from audiences not actively seeking their brand.Xero have a lot of top 5 rankings on Google for high volume non-branded keywords related to their services, including “inventory management software”, “invoicing software”, “payroll”, and “purchase order” – which is great.Most importantly, Xero’s at the top of page 1 in the #2 spot for their top keyword phrase “accounting software”.They’re also in spot #1 and #2 for “small business accounting” and #3 for “small business accounting software”.While they have a bit more work to do, remember that this is a highly competitive space with many advertisers also competing for these particular keywords in paid search.This means that by ranking organically and driving traffic to service pages for these terms, Xero can actually calculate – based on the volume of page traffic and the average cost per click for Google Ads – the money they are saving.Invoice template termsAs Brendan explained in his look at “Paid Search”, one of the more interesting non-branded keyword campaigns that Xero have targeted and tested has been around invoicing – in particular, invoice template terms and electronic invoicing terms.Note: Xero are already dominating the “invoicing” keyword rankings, holding both positions #1 and #2 on the first page of Google for theirInvoicing service pageandInvoicing Survival Guide. They’re also one the first page in position #5 for “invoice software”, but the search volume is quite low for this term with only 720 average monthly searches.Looking at the keyword “invoice template” in Google Keyword Planner, we can see that it has that an average monthly search volume of 14,800 with high competition and a suggested bid of $17.02.From SEMrush Organic Positions report, we can see that Xero is in position #4 on page 1 for this highly competitive term.Xero has a bit of a way to go to get their organic page ranking above the fold.Two ways they could continue to improve this page’s rankings include:A more diverse and aggressive backlink acquisition strategy (a topic I’ll speak more on shortly) for this URLAnd create content to be published on third-party websites on topics such as “How a Small Business Can Make the Switch from Manual to Automated Accounting” and “What Templates a Sole Trader Needs to Run a Business” with a natural link back to this page.BONUS:Not getting results from your SEO strategy?

I’ve also sorted by volume to see what the average number of times these terms of search per month on average.From the basis of this report, Xero is doing very well competing with MYOB and Intuit Quickbook. However, we can see a number of small opportunities that Xero could consider going after in order to drive more organic traffic to their platform and away from MYOB and Quickbooks.The one that really jumps out at me is “ bas” (short for Business Activity Statement) with an average monthly search volume of 8,100. There’s also “lodge bas online” (1,300), “how to lodge bas online (140), “submit bas online” (110), and “bas for dummies” (50).While MYOB and Quickbooks both rank on page 1, Xero is nowhere to be seen.On further research, I found thatXero does have one page that talks about “bas”, but the title tag has been optimised to rank for “Business Activity Statement’. While it is ranking in page #11 for this keyword, it has a lower average search volume of just 1,600, and still sits below MYOB and Reckon. They could create a dedicated page such as a ‘small business guide’ to target the higher volume primary term “bas” and the lower volume secondary terms such as “how to lodge bas online”.While it has a much lower volume than the above, it’s interesting to see that MYOB is ranking in position #1 for “starting a cafe” (210), and Quickbooks in is position #8. Why have they done this? While it’s a small volume, if someone is thinking about opening a cafe then providing them with the information early on is a great tactic to build awareness and nurture the reader early in the sales funnel. While Xero has a dedicated service page for “Cafe Accounting Software” it is currently targeting the much lower volume keywords around “run a small cafe’ (10). They could optimise the web copy or create more site content to better target audiences looking to get started and rank alongside their competitors.According toMoz, 71% of search traffic clicks occur on page one of Google, and page two results come in at below 6% of all website clicks.To see which keywords that the competition rank for on page one that Xero ranks for on page 2+, I changed the settings and generated a report in SEMrush’s Keyword Gap Tool.The content that Xero ranks for in positions #11- #100 are the pages they should consider updating and improving upon. And in SEO, it’s thrilling to be able to move a #2 page keyword onto page #1, and so on.We can see two keywords that Xero could easily try to move from page #2 to page #1. In fact, their page #2 ranking for “bas return” reinforces the above gap analysis insight that Xero should optimise their “Business Activity Statement” page for “bas” and its related keywords (i.e. bas return) if they want to be more competitive.Keyword comparisonXero have aligned the keywords from their paid search campaigns with their primary organic search campaigns. In comparing theirpayroll landing page copyto theirpayroll service page copy, the same keywords reoccur.This means that the keywords for their landing pages and ads copy are being seamlessly used across their website organically, so there’s less of a disconnect between the two strategies and messaging is consistent for their audiences.OptimisationsWe used Screaming Frog SEO Spider to crawl the website and see if Xero have optimised their ‘Features and Tools’ pages’ title tags and meta descriptions – and no surprise, all pages are optimised for their purpose and for the users intent. See the full report here.Meta tags are the first impression search engine crawlers get when crawling your content, and the title tag is the most important. For that reason, your primary keyword should be as close to your title tag as possible. Xero has included the primary keyword in the title tag (i.e page title) and they have followed best practice and kept their title tags to less than 70 characters.The meta descriptions include the primary keywords and speak to the platform’s USPs, their ‘no fuss’ approach to accounting, and the benefits gained from the features and tools.Rating Schema markupXero’s site structure and on-site SEO is generally very strong, however there is one way in which they can improve.Schema markup provides more information to Google to tell them what specific sections of the website or page are about. Google then feeds this info back into the search results page so to enrich the search result and give the user more information, potentially increasing the chances of someone clicking through as well as being a ranking factor.One of the biggest ones Xero could add is for reviews.As Tam covered earlier, Xero was awarded a Canstar Blue award for having the most satisfied customers. They also have a number of reviews and testimonials on their site, so we know they get plenty of them. They also have a lot of reviews from industry and software publishers as you can see when you search for “Xero reviews”See the little star ratings under some of the search results? Those sites are using schema markup to bring their score into the search results, and Xero should be doing the same.To do this, all Xero needs to do is implement areviews snippet codeonto their website (usually added into the footer) which tells Google the rating and number of reviews to display in the search results and where they came from.Since Xero already has a lot of reviews on a range of platforms they can either choose one of the sites (such as Capterra where they have 1,366 reviews) and use this in the review snippets code and search results. Alternatively they can look at utilising anAggregate Ratingto take advantage of all of the reviews they have in different places.Once they’ve added the code snippet to the site, Google will automatically pick this up and will then choose on what pages and when to show the reviews feature – when they do, it can have a big impact on organic click-through rate and rankings.Generating and using positive reviews is a pretty big task that I could write a lot about but this isn’t the place for it.

And Xero has had a link acquisition strategy in place from the get-go.MYOB has been an accounting software provider for longer than Xero. Despite this, according to Ahrefs Xero has a higher domain authority. What we can conclude from this is that by comparing the cumulative referring domains over time, Xero launched with an active SEO strategy. It appears MYOB considered this as part of their digital strategy much later, which meant they fell behind in authority despite being active for longer.This is why you need to consider SEO from the outset. It could be a gamechanger.XeroMYOBXero began by acquiring backlinks from accounting websites around 2014 and grew this approach in 2016 with bookkeepers.We took a good look at these backlinks and could see that these accountants and bookkeepers likely use the platform and may be in their Partner Program. While a good place to start, these referring domains have a relatively low value for Xero with domain ratings typically less than 30. Despite this, the value of Xero doing this in the beginning has been that they’re highly relevant as they come from websites within their industry, given a strong level of correlation between the backlinks and Xero’s domain.They achieved these links through a badge link acquisition strategy. The concept is straightforward – you design a badge to serve as a medallion of recognition. The badge functions as the link anchor when displayed on target sites, and should be relevant not only to your site but the sites that will actively and proudly display it.This is an advanced growth link tactic used by SaaS providers like Xero to have their partners advertise that their brand is the preferred platform. This also provides their customers with the ability to advertise their level of investment in their platform i.e Gold Partners, Certified Agency, etc. And as a result of this strategy, accountants and bookkeepers have become brand advocates for Xero.Depending on the size of the website that the badge is put on, it is common to have these in the footer of the website. The benefit of this is that you don’t only get the value of the referring domain, but it also includes a higher volume of backlinks because it’s on every page of the website.In the beginning, this approach is really labour intensive because it requires people to be front facing, actively seeking new business relationships. The pay-off for Xero has been that once those relationships were built, they’ve been able to leverage the SEO focused strategy as well as build brand ambassadors.Xero has a hugemarketplace of applicationsthat users can connect with Xero. This has flowed into a predominant part of their backlinking profile, and we can see they’ve gained backlinks from other high-value sites through this approach. Each SaaS platform they integrate with typically has a dedicated content page featuring their relationship with Xero and linking back to key pages of their website.To note, while this has been a great SEO strategy, it has also formed a strong role in their growth as each page gives them exposure to another brand’s users and the opportunity to convert leads into trial users.Take the followingXero+Square partnership, for instance – there are instructions not only on how to integrate with the platform, but a well-placed call-to-action on signing-up for Xero’s free trial by linking adedicated partnership branded sign-up page.This approach shows they understand the customer journey, and how to get good SEO and CRO from their partnerships.Over the last two years, Xero has ramped up their approach to backlinks, going after inbound links from high domain authority news publications with strong established audiences. They’ve done this through time-sensitive PR style link acquisition tactics, using relevant articles like this one onnews.com.autalking about tax time and with media releases to tech sites like this one ontechworld.com.au.They have then scaled this approach by actively seeking opportunities to be thought leaders on specific topics with wide audience reach, allowing them to gain backlinks and build profiles on sites like these ones on Business Insider.Finally, we can see that Xero is organically generating natural PR links through being an innovative and unique brand. Reputable brands – likepwc– are noticing their cut through in the marketplace and speaking about it. Though not something you can actively aim for, it helps that Xero is considered innovative in the tech industry. They’ve also won awards and been mentioned in lists like the AFR Fast 50 which helps raise their profile and makes others like PWC, Business Insider, and even Webprofits, want to talk about them.Content MarketingXero has a solidcontent marketingstrategy in place, creating truly global content that speaks to their target audiences at every stage of the customer journey.As I’ve already discussed, Xero is using content to build links. But it also serves three other key purposes: to attract, to nurture, and to retain.The following content areas highlight their varied approaches:Small Business Guides –Targets potential small business owners to increase brand awareness through search optimised content (i.e guides and checklists) that focuses on driving organic traffic from short to long tail search queries.Accountant/bookkeeper Guides –Targets accountants/bookkeepers to increase brand awareness through search optimised content (i.e guides and checklists) that focuses on driving organic traffic from short to long tail search queries.Accountant/Bookkeeper stories –Utilises narrative-style testimonials to speak to accountants and bookkeepers as they consider whether they should grow their practice with Xero.Training courses: Xero U –Looking to convert and retain customers, this education hub guides users on using the product through live course webinars offering training on Xero from their trial to add-ons.Xero TV –Used to both attract and retain, Xero TV forms the core of Xero’s video content strategy.Podcasts –Audio series featuring advice and stories from small business owners and industry experts.Blog –Features news about the platform and Xero’s partners, as well as product information and updates for customers.Small business insights– This is a data and report segment of the site, using content to build the brand’s reputation through offering insights and economic analysis that can be easily linked to, quoted, and shared by media and industry experts.Attracting small business ownersXero has a lot of content, but I’ll be looking at the “Small Business Guides” content strategy as this is the predominant approach they’ve used to attract small business owners.The “Small Business Guides” offer tips and tricks for small business owners from ‘invoicing tips for beginners’ to ‘how to hire a bookkeeper’ and ‘understanding cloud computing’.By creating valuable content that is keyword focused, Xero has been able to rank for highly competitive keywords and drive organic traffic to their website.This top of the funnel style content performs an important purpose: to educate and warm these colder audiences, in turn, building brand awareness and trust.So, what’s their approach and is it working?Xero has created articles and in-depth guides around each of their services (invoicing, accounting, bookkeeping, marketing, business management, payroll, and so on) to improve their visibility in search and give link juice to each of their service and feature pages.These categories form “content pillars”.Pillar Content is a strategydesigned to improve traffic and keyword rankings for important keywords. This type of content is a large, highly valuable piece that is linked to by smaller pieces of content on the blog, known as cluster content.The goal is to have several pillars on the blog, each targeting a specific keyword cluster. Each relevant piece of cluster content will also link back to the main page, and this internal linking structure will help rank the content in SERPs.Generating external links to the main pillar page through guest posts will further assist with this.Xero has a killer pillar strategy for “invoicing”, which has helped them achieve their strong keyword rankings for invoicing (positions #1 and #2 on page 1 of Google – see above) and drive organic traffic in this highly competitive space.At the core of their invoicing pillar strategy is the “Invoicing Survival Guide”, which explains how invoicing works from start to finish.They have a large cluster of invoicing articles which target long-tail search queries such as “Invoice format tips for beginners”. These cluster articles link back to the guide, invoice template, other cluster articles, and invoicing service pages.A large resource like this “Invoicing Survival Guide” is a good way of acquiring backlinks, as sites will naturally link back to valuable content.Many companies make the tradeoff of gating valuable resources like this in order to capture email addresses – subsequently completely missing out on the SEO benefits. For companies more focused on building email lists, this could be the right strategy for them. But for Xero, using it for organic has paid off.The Guide is also available as a pdf download, but Xero has still not utilised this opportunity to capture email addresses and nurture these potential customers through an automated email sequence. Rather, they are focused on social media engagement and remarketing.Subsequently, Xero is promoting the guide onFacebookand sending people through to this nurture- and conversion-focusedlanding page.Xero TVThe video content being produced for Xero TV is integral for the brand’s retention strategies. For existing customers and programme partners, the video library reflects the platform’s benefits and capabilities through support advice for SMBs and program partners.This approach has enabled Xero to establish connections and nurture relationships with customers by helping them overcome business pain-points, and also retain them by shifting the conversation to product-centric content.Here are some examples of the videos they share in the How-to category.All of the videos share information on how to do a specific process within the platform, and the subcategories are broken down nicely so that it’s easy to find.I would assume there was a significant time and cost investment on Xero’s part in order to create all of these videos, but the benefits would far outweigh it. The videos are the first step in a user troubleshooting when they can’t figure out how to do something on the platform. The more they can educate themselves, the less frustrated they will be, and the less frustrated they are, the less likely they are to churn and go with another provider.They even have a Xero 101 section for first time users to be able to set everything up without any problems. That way, the relationship is frictionless from the start and they have a satisfied customer from day one.Using the data from videoXero has an active and often-updated YouTube channel (which Dan will cover later in this article), so why have a platform dedicated to video on their website? Well, this plays into a larger, more complex marketing strategy: understanding every stage of the customer journey and timing their messaging accordingly.From the moment a user starts watching a video on their site, the Xero marketing team uses Marketo andBrightcoveto track how long their watch, where they drop off, and what actions they take next.Sounds simple, right? But it’s what Xero can do with this information that matters.Equipped with this knowledge, they can use this to understand the customer journey, from awareness through to conversion and retention. They can use this data to spark the next conversation and create content that speaks to users on social, or with a new video-centric landing page, or another sales outreach campaign. They can also tweak their existing content campaigns, onboarding sequences, and automated newsletters to create frictionless journeys.Xero has formed an intrinsic relationship between content and business results, and shown that video can be a strong driver of key performance metrics (brand awareness, impressions, engagement, leads and sales).By putting the customer at the centre of your content, you can both attract and retain a network of users. Look to speak to your audience and collect as much valuable data that provides insights into your customers’ journey, so you can hone your marketing strategy across their preferred channels.SocialXero is across a variety of platforms for many different reasons. They seem to understand that every social space requires a different approach to content, rather than just reposting the same content on every different account they have. The following accounts were audited in the order in which they are used the most: Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. With each different platform, an approach unique to that platform’s offering is taken – resulting in what I would call a comprehensive Social Media strategy.Facebook (organic)First, let’s talk about the organic aspects of their Facebook campaigns. Xero has taken multiple approaches to reach its audience organically. They regularly post to their page, have a community management strategy in place, organise regular Facebook Events, and even dabble in some Community Group strategies.Posting & Community ManagementXero is posting content on the page about every 1-3 days, with content types including video, event promotion, and blog content. Honestly, the content is nothing to write home about and seems to only be posted to keep up the appearance of an active page.The presence of ow.ly links tells me they have been using Hootsuite to schedule and post their content. This is a great way to keep your page populated with content, especially if you don’t plan on promoting and actually leveraging that content to grow your business. Could it be a more engaging and thought out strategy? Sure. But would I ever recommend a client of mine focus resources on organic Facebook page posts as a way to drive growth? No way.Since the posts don’t seem to be promoted in any way, the engagement numbers aren’t what I would call an adequate amount to really drive growth. However, it gives users a space to make comments, resulting in some (sometimes pretty intense, sometimes pretty funny) customer service inquiries and responses. Their response time is quick, which usually indicates they have a dedicated team to respond to social community inquiries, something we would always recommend including in your strategy.I double-checked their Messenger presence to see if they have a Chatbot strategy in place and, just like their commenting, it would seem they have someone dedicated to answer those messages as fast as possible (they answered me in less than 1 minute). This is great if you have the resources available, but I’d always recommend having some kind of automated response sequence to filter out the users that can answer their own questions by following a prompt.Facebook EventsXero, being a pretty large company, will obviously be hosting events around the world. And the great thing about their Facebook presence is they make it known. It would seem that every event offered to the public is included as a standalone event on Facebook.This really gives people a sense that the company is making moves. It’s also an incredibly powerful aspect of organic reach these days, as “Interested” user actions to the events will show up on their friend and family News Feeds (for free!).(We’ll cover the events themselves in more detail later in the article).BONUS:Get in touch to learn more about ourPaid Traffic Audit. Our team of world class paid media consultants will crunch the numbers, analyse the data and dig into the results of your Facebook Ads account to ensure your money is being spent wisely.Facebook Community GroupsNow that organic reach (on Facebook) is basically dead, Facebook’s brand-owned Community Groups are one way for brands to reach their audiences for free.While I wasn’t able to gain access to the groups themselves, I can tell this is a strategy they are exploring. The groups are closed and seem to be on an invite-only basis.While it’s nice that they are exploring the value of these kinds of groups, if I was speaking directly to them as a consultant, I’d recommend finding a way to connect their core product with a solution-based sharing community.Take one of the largest Community Groups – Facebook Ad Buyers. Tim Burd (a Facebook Marketing Guru) created a community where people like me can get together and discuss the latest and greatest about Facebook Ads and strategy.It’s full of questions being answered, arguments and solutions, and every once in a while a sprinkle of sales focused marketing by Tim himself. This is the new organic when it comes to Facebook.Some companies are ahead of the curve in creating and nurturing audiences through groups, but I believe it will get a lot bigger and that building an online community will be an important part of most successful business strategies in the not too distant future.Facebook AdsAlright. Now that we’ve taken a look at how they spend their time on Facebook, let’s look at how they spend their money. I could honestly write page after page on every region’s ads, but for now, let’s focus on Australia.From what I can tell through Facebook’s “Info and Ads” sections, Xero is targeting multiple audiences with pretty different messages. The ad objectives range from converting prospects into customers, signing up for an Accounting event in Sydney, and listening to their podcast “First Year Frontiers.”I’m going to break down their ads by a few key categories that I would segment my strategy by.Content TypeXero is using multiple ad formats including vertical and horizontal video, static imagery and even some animated “GIFs” (Thats pronounced Jifs, not Gifs btw). I like to see this in an ads strategy as, realistically, we really don’t know what will resonate best with our audience. Sure Facebook (and a lot of marketing channels) are always saying VIDEO IS KING. But honestly, I’ve run plenty of campaigns where static stock photography was the clear winner in a campaign.Basically, Xero does a good job of varying their ad formats to ensure it never gets boring.Creative and MessagingIt’s very clear to me that Xero wants to come off as simple to use. Their messaging is very straight and to the point. No long headlines. No fancy paragraphs. Just short, easy to digest messaging that gets the main point across. This is a GREAT way to use a bit of subliminal messaging to represent your product when you’re in an industry that can seem pretty daunting to a new business owner. The words are simple. We are simple. Our product is simple. Easy.Some example headlines they use:Satisfied? Satisfied.New to business?Helping small businesses thrive.Help your clients succeed.Track jobs on the go.A groundbreaking analysis.This is also apparent in the creative for the ads. If it’s video, it’s quick and sometimes shot with an iPhone. If it’s branded imagery, they make sure to have the product as the main focal point, leaving the real work to the copy.CampaignsWith the messaging of the different Ads I’m able to see, I can tell there are multiple campaigns set up to deliver to a variety of audiences. It’s clear they are targeting both new potential customers as well as spending ad budget targeting their existing customers.Spending money reaching out to your customers is a really great strategy in my opinion. It keeps your clients involved, makes sure you remain top-of-mind, and keeps them invested in the idea of your product.Here’s a breakdown of what I can tell is part of their funnel strategy.COLD AUDIENCES (People that aren’t familiar with Xero)WARM AUDIENCES (People that are aware of Xero)HOT AUDIENCES (Customers)You can see from the above ads that the messaging is pretty different for each kind of audience I assume they are being delivered to.With the “cold” audience ads, the messaging is problem- and solution-focused. How can our business help yours, what can we do for you, etc.The “warm” audiences tend to showcase the brand a bit more, giving further insight into not only how reputable the company is but also how proactive in the industry they are. This gives users who are just starting to get to know Xero an interesting look at their efforts – a good use of social proof.Once we get to the converted or “hot” audience ads, it’s all about the brand play. I don’t think Xero wants these ads to do anything other than keep their audience of customers happy, engaged, and thinking positively about Xero. Showcasing awards is always a safe bet in keeping that positive message in front of your clients, and I think the ads they’ve chosen to do so look great.If I could only get a look into their ads account I’d be able to provide those reading this some real statistical data analysis … maybe one of their team will reach out when we publish this and I can do a follow up 😉InstagramI’m just going to start out by saying I am absolutely in love with Xero’s IG strategy. They do an amazing job of utilising this platform for what it was truly made for.They’ve just started posting IG Stories and IGTV episodes, but those strategies are in their infancy. I’m going to focus on their Organic Instagram Posts strategy. I’ll break down why I love it in three reasons:1. It’s customer focusedUGC or User Generated Content is one of the best ways to spread the message that your company is treating customers right. Xero has done an amazing job showcasing their happy customer stories.Not only do they showcase their happy customers, they tag them and essentially provide free promotion for each one’s business. This, to me, is essential in today’s digital climate. Nobody wants to feel like a customer. We’re all just partners digitally collaborating, right? That’s the feeling I get from this Instagram page. Advocating for your customers is just as important as them advocating for you, no matter what size your business is.2. It’s simpleAlmost every single post is the exact same format, making their strategy easy to understand and digest. Anyone visiting the page will know exactly what they’re looking at from post to post.Each post contains a photo of their customer, a quote about the product, and some hashtags.This kind of strategy, once the bits and bobs are worked out, would easily be able to be actioned by an intern or part-timer. One of the hardest things about a creative strategy is finding a way to keep the ROI positive. I’d wager they don’t spend more than 10 minutes a day implementing this strategy, and it truly shines as a part of their digital campaign.3. The content fits the platformOne of the biggest mistakes a company can make on Instagram is to post the wrong kind of content. If we compare Xero’s FB vs IG content, you can see the obvious difference in imagery and tone of voice.“Branded Imagery” is not used on IG – some (even many of those on my own team) would argue this point with me but I truly believe branded or “designed” imagery has no place on an organic Instagram strategy (unless of course you are a graphic design team or similar). Xero simply posts photos of their customers. No overlayed text. No logo. It’s clean, gets its message across, and doesn’t interrupt a user’s experiences. Kudos, Xero.LinkedInI’m not going to focus much on LinkedIn in this article as, to be completely honest, their LinkedIn strategy from what I can tell is just a mirror of their Facebook posting strategy. No shame or harm in this kind of strategy, especially for an Accounting Software company.I’d be willing to wager what works on Facebook would most likely work just as well if not better on LinkedIn. This would be one of the few times I’d suggest keeping the format and messaging similar across the platforms. The only thing to keep in mind here is that whatever you’re paying on Facebook, be ready to pay ~5X for the same results on LinkedIn.I’m sure Xero are running Ads on LinkedIn. I’ve tried numerous times to get into their remarketing sequence on there but haven’t had any luck. If their ads strategy is anything like their Facebook Ads strategy, I’d say the messaging and imagery is pretty much still on point. If it were me, I’d run a few more highly targeted eBook or content pieces on LinkedIn to really grab those expensive users details so I’d have the opportunity to remarket to them on a cheaper platform later.TwitterTwitter is a tough one these days. They’ve got a few problems that make it hard for marketers to execute a well-rounded strategy on the platform.For one thing, it’s not visual at all. Unless you have a VERYboldstatement that can be expressed through mostly text, you’re just not going to get the cut through you’re looking for.I think Twitter is another one of Xero’s strategies where it’s updated regularly, customer and fan inquiries are taken care of promptly, but there just isn’t the opportunity there for them to justify investing a significant amount of resources to the platform. A good move in my eyes.Social overviewNow that we’ve had a glimpse into what Xero is doing on Social, I can honestly say I think their team is killing it. They have their main focus areas taken care of, are delivering a constant stream of high-quality content AND they’re not afraid to begin testing out new areas of opportunity. They’re also smart enough to realise where their opportunities live and die, and adjust their resources accordingly.If I could get in a room with them, I’d tell them their nextmainarea of focus would be those tasty “Organic Facebook Community Groups.” With a following like theirs, and budget and traffic numbers, they could easily begin growing a community of small business owners to nurture and convert. This is by far the biggest growth opportunity in the game right now, so I suggest they jump on it before Facebook decides to diminish and monetise.Community MarketingEver heard of community marketing? It’s a fairly new term that is getting traction within the marketing and business world as more businesses are looking at ways to keep their existing customers engage and increase referrals – and at the same time, build a stronger brand.To refresh your memory, we wrote an articleabout everything community marketinga few months ago. Just some key stats about why Community marketing is important as part of your strategy:Happy customers tell an average of 9 people about their experience with a product/service.14x more likely to sell to an existing customer rather than a new one.And even with a small retention rate of only 5%, it is going to look better for your bottom line with potential to lead to a 25-30% increase in profit.Currently doing community marketing? Don’t worry, there are many companies that aren’t – or, many companies who don’t have the right strategy.Know who is doing community marketing well? You guessed it… Xero. The company prides themselves on keeping their audience base engaged particularly around the “loyalty” stage of their funnel.About Xero Community PortalXero has set up a community portal in order to centralise, build and connect Xero customers and partners, as well as other key stakeholders in the ecosystem, to be part of the conversation around platform features (technical help with APIs, etc), solve issues, and also swap ideas and tips.The benefits of Community for XeroAside from the obvious benefits above with community marketing generally, Xero have created their community with two main goals in mind:Advocacy– They want their customers to BE THE EXPERTS. It’s clearly stated in theircommunity guidelines. Would you most likely become the customer of a product or service by being told by the sales team, or someone who is an actual customer? Xero are putting the power in the hands of the customers’ and partners’ hands – they are building an army of brand advocates to help continue to build the Xero ecosystem. Not to mention this is a great UGC (User Generated Content) strategy.‘Control’ through Listening & Feedback– What’s the biggest factor when growing your business? Actively listening straight from the horse’s mouth – customers! Building an active community is a great way to ‘control’ what customers and partners are saying about the platform, and Xero would be looking out for;Customer pain pointsPlatform feature requestsPlatform troubleshooting.Reduced customer support resources –Customer-driven communities are a great way to reduce the required customer support from the IT or customer support team for Xero. New customers to Xero can get answers directly from those existing customers who can say, “I went through this experience as well, here’s the best way I fixed this”.Real-time listening & being able to create an open space for customers and partners to share their experience is an effective way to “put out fires” and speed up innovation internally to satisfy customer demands.Anything that is said in the community is thenloggedand passed onto the team.How they maintain and organise their communityThis image above is just part of one of 3 community pillars that is part of their community ecosystem. For the topic of “Accounting alone”, there are3627 active discussions happeningin just one thread – amazing. In conjunction with a search bar on the left hand side, finding answers and support from the community ensures existing customers and potential prospects know that there is an answer for effectively using the platform.They structure their community into 3 main pillars based on expertise:Xero Business– General questions around accounting, small business, feature requests, App reviews, etc.Developer– Discussion for developers within the organisation around Xero’s API and 3rd party libraries/tools.Xero Central– Specific topics about using the Xero platform – this pillar is focused on solving direct customer issues quickly by the Xero team.Key Takeaway:Building a strong community for your brand is not an easy task, but once you build an established community, the dividends will pay off. Your word-of-mouth will increase and improve themarketing effectiveness of your brand by 54%. It’s a no-brainer.Event MarketingAbout XeroconXerocon is one the largest and most innovative Cloud-based global accounting conferences, having first launched in February 2010. The conference rotates across Australian capital cities and, for the past few years, the conference is also hosted in other parts of the world including London, UK and Atlanta, US.Each conference has an average attendance of over 3,000 accountants and bookkeepers – there’s no wonder why Xero keep running annual conferences.SourceSourceThe benefits of running a conference are simple – they allow you to become the thought leader in the industry and connect directly with prospects and existing customers, tying in key sales and business objectives.According to a recent reportEvent Marketing 2018: Benchmarks & Trends Report, it states that marketers (80%) attribute event marketing as one of the most important marketing channels contributing to their marketing funnel initiatives in B2B.Why? Event marketing coincides with all parts of the funnel from awareness to loyalty stages.How Xero is using Xerocon as part of their marketing strategyHow does Xero consistently market and fill out their conferences? How does Xero use it as part of their marketing strategy?Xero has one overarching goal in mind – providing exceptional value. Xero makes the partner network and customers their number 1 priority.The conference is shaped by Xero as a great centrepoint to connect all stakeholders together to foster new partnerships, share business objectives for ongoing client growth, and accounting best practices.One purpose for running events comes down to customer psychology – Xero is making their audience work for them, without their customers and partners directly realising it.When it comes to conferences, it’s about giving customers and partners that feeling of being the centre of attention which then enhances growth levers for all parties.A conference is a perfect time for the internal teams to absorb as much information as possible to improve product features and experiences.Xero run conferences around these 4 key objectives coinciding with all levels of the marketing funnel:Education– Inspire and educate existing and potential prospects around the latest updates in accounting technology by world-class speakers.Community-Building– Xerocon is the perfect opportunity to connect partner networks globally into one central location, fostering new partnership opportunities of companies who attend.Ecosystem Partners– It’s the best time to meet potential partners face-to-face. Customers can seek advisors and partners to help with their business objectives, especially around ongoing client growth.Promoting of the product– Is there any better way than announcing new product updates in front of approximately 3500 loyal partners/customers and potential new prospects?Not only that, Xerocon is the perfect time for partners and customers to chat directly to Xero’s developer and product teams. Direct feedback through face-to-face conversationally in a scalable and practical manner means Xero can understand potential pain points and product requests in more detail, rather than getting customers to fill out surveys and support chat where extensive details can be missed. This promotes more loyal and advocacy within their funnel because Xero is taking the time to create a human connection, which in turn ensures customers are being heard (psychologically feel important) and have the necessary access to share their opinions with Xero and accounting practices.SourceIn order to achieve these 4 key objectives through event marketing, and to attract consistent audience attendances at every event location each year, Xero focuses on key characteristics of any amazing event by providing experiences that are built on each year.Speakers– World-class speakers who are cloud-accounting experts sharing the latest knowledge. As stated on their event website, they bring speakers who share their inspiring world’s to both business and personal life.Exhibition/Partners –The exhibition for participants is a key highlight of the multi-day conference. Illustrated above, connecting partners and customers within the network is where partnerships turn into fruition. Theattendees love it.Xero Uni Day (Education)– Not only are attendees increasing their education of cloud-accounting practices and processes through headline speakers, but also through Xero’s ‘Uni-days’, which incorporate workshops and the opportunity to work with peers. This also provides another juncture for Xero’s internal team to assist and collect information around customer product behaviours in real-time.Key Takeaway:Conferences such as Xerocon, or event marketing generally, are not always easy to execute and can be costly without a thorough strategy. However events – especially if a company is B2B – is a great idea to be a part of any marketing strategy as it touches on all areas of a marketing funnel.Direct human connection with stakeholders and customers is key to directly communicate business messages and keep engagement high.YouTubeIt’s 2018, we all know that video marketing is important, but how many businesses are actually using it as a channel to help with their marketing funnel?Video marketing is undoubtedly a great way for businesses to drive new customers throughout the awareness, consideration and conversion stage of the funnel. In addition, it can also drive retention and advocacy from existing customer bases.However, there’s still a small percentage of businesses (even large successful businesses) in Australia who are producing great video content and actively engaging and growing their channel throughout the customer journey.Why have a YouTube Channel & How Xero are using itYouTube is a great marketing channel where companies can share stories, introduce products or services, and present product demonstrations. Xero are executing their YouTube and Video Content Strategy exceptionally well, producing high-quality, up-to-date and in-depth content through various categories.The use of video is a great opportunity to engage new and existing customers which contributes to organic website visitors, sales and referrals.We can see Xero has used different types of video content pillars that fit into different parts of their marketing funnel, including:Small Business Guides(Awareness Stage)– Video content playlist which illustrates the benefits of cloud-based accounting, tutorial and explainer videos of general accounting topics.Behind your Business(Consideration Stage)– A “Behind the business” series that incorporates existing Xero customers and their stories of creating/starting their businesses, which ties in with specific features of Xero supporting their respective day-to-day business activities.Xero 101: Learn the features(Retention Stage)– Video playlist on the essential features of using the software – setup, bank reconciliation, reporting, invoicing, etc.Best Business Apps(Awareness/Consideration Stages)– A general video playlist around business apps which can help small businesses, interviewing real-world customers using various applications.The Advisors(Awareness Stage)– Highlighting the world of cloud-accounting from some of the top minds in the world.Customer stories(Consideration Stage)– Similar to the “Behind Your Business” series, further satisfied customer stories and testimonials of using Xero.(Sub Heading) Factors that contribute to a successful YouTube ChannelEvery YouTube channel has different success factors, however, the successful YouTube channels execute key factors within YouTube that contributes to the growth of their channel.1. MetadataXero crafts their metadata in order to improve visibility potential of being discovered within the YouTube network by those who are on the platform looking at similar content.Whilst there’s opportunity to include more keywords in their descriptions, Xero has used keywords relevant to reach their target audience. Also, they’ve structured their metadata well with short dialogue/key quotes from the video, using #behindyourbusiness campaign hashtag, link to the content series, calls-to-action, as well as additional links to their services.2. Well-crafted Video HeadlinesGreat use of video titles which are informative and to the point, which in turn improves click-through-rate.3. Video ThumbnailsConsistent, branded thumbnails across all video categories ensures YouTube viewers and prospect customers can see content easily and increase CTR.Key Takeaway:Creating video content is one thing, but without a well-designed, categorised, metadata-rich and varied video content touching various stages of your marketing funnel, your YouTube channel will have less of a chance of performing or being found. Includingkey ingredientsfor your YouTube strategy, such as these three above, will ensure the best chance of YouTube growth success.Final wordsI’ve always been a fan of Xero but after delving deeper into how they market themselves my estimation of them has still increased significantly. It’s no surprise to me that they’ve disrupted the accounting software landscape and achieved such rapid growth.Though we’ve covered a lot of channels and tactics, and picked out individual elements that are great or need work, I think an important thing to note is the holistic approach that Xero take.Not only are they across a number of channels, and doing them well, they are also consistent with their messaging and approach throughout. Their commitment to being a simple, easy to use platform that puts the customer first shines through in a number of ways:Website copy and imagery highlights customers and focuses on simplicityBranding and marketing images are clear, clean and to the pointSocial media ads have very simple copy and headlinesEmail marketing onboarding process helps users get the most out of the platformInstagram posts hero their customer storiesContent is created specifically to help existing customersEvents educate but also welcome feedback for improvementThey have built their own platform for their customers to become a community.Every business is different, and every marketing strategy should be unique, so we’re not recommending that all companies should focus on being simple and customer centric.What we’re highlighting is that Xero has understood exactly what it is that their audience love about them, and what makes them stand out from the competition who have been in business for a long time. They’ve then taken this understanding and applied it throughout their digital presence to ensure the message connects with their audience.And that, in my opinion, is why they’ve been such a success story, and will continue to grow over the coming years.BONUS:Take your marketing to the next level with a multi-channel growth strategy.

Canva’s Digital Growth StrategyHomePortfolioPodcastInsightsMedia CentreNewsletterCareersContact UsBack to Homepage at Webprofits BlogCanva’s Digital Growth Strategy04 Nov 2019|Tam Al-Saad - Get more articles like this sent to your emailhereFew companies have experienced growth at the same scale as Canva.In less than 7 years, they have acquired over15 MILLION users, 300,000 paying customers, and have been valued at 3.2 billion dollars (USD) after recently closing a $125m (USD) funding round.In the first 2 years alone, they reached 2 million users —averaging 3,600 signups a day, or 111,111 signups per month.So, what sent Canva into hypergrowth?Undoubtedly, their product and business model played a huge role. There was nothing like it at the time.But like any product, they had to make sure people heard about them and knew what they did.That’s where marketing comes in.It started back in 2012, when one of the co-founders – Melanie Perkins – was teaching students how to use programs like InDesign and Photoshop — software that people found hard to learn and even harder to use.At the time, the only tools on the market for graphic design were far too ‘overpowered’ and complex for most people to use.Therehadto be a better way for the average person to create beautiful designs. After realising that this was a potential starving market, Melanie set out to create Fusion Books, which later evolved into a separate product: Canva.In this growth study, we’ll dig into how Canva acquires users by analysing:What they do to acquire trafficHow they turn that traffic into usersBONUS:Rather have this case study as a PDF?Click here to downloadit and read it whenever you're read, plus receive similar articles and case studies via email.Behind the strategyCanva’s acquisition strategy relies on 2 pillars:Astarving crowd:people hungry for a better way to create beautiful designsTheircompany vision:helping everyone create beautiful designs without frictionTheir vision happens to align perfectly with the needs of that starving crowd.They use their vision as the overarching message for all campaigns using a framework calledJobs To Be Done.It’s based on the idea that your customers are trying to accomplish something with your product — that’s the “Job” that needs to be done.These jobs could be something like:I want to design graphics quickly and easily.Or we can dive deeper:I want to create a Facebook ad without the frustration of using Photoshop.These are, in essence, more specific variations of their company vision. As we analyse and dissect Canva’s growth strategy, you’ll notice that almost everything Canva does aligns to the needs of the starving crowd by showing them how they can achieve the job that they’re trying to accomplish— being able to design anything, quickly.WebsiteProduct PagePaid SearchSocial media adsOrganic Search and SEOContent marketingWebsiteAfter analysing the website, I came to the conclusion that the following pages are the highest priority for user and customer acquisition.The Home Page — page goal: converting highly-educated traffic into ‘freemium’ and trial usersProduct page — page goal: converting cold and warm traffic into trial usersThere’s another page which I was tempted to analyse: theCanva Pro product page, but decided against it as we’re under the impression that its main purpose is to upsell free users into Pro users, not for acquiring new users.Home pageThe first thing you notice about the home page is the simplicity. It’s not a common strategy. But with Canva being so intuitive, powerful and quick to use, they’d prefer to lead with the product rather than spend a lot of time explaining with text.They keep it simple by letting the screenshot of the desktop and mobile app provide some – but not much – context about the product.Having a lot of information on the homepage will steal attention away from what’smostimportant to their business goals:signups and product usage.They make it super easy to sign up.1-click options with Google and FacebookOr your email addressAnd to encourage product usage, they show a row of design ideas based on user jobs:Once you choose what you want to design, you get pushed into an action-to-onboard flow to get users to see create a graphic before they get the chance to sign up with details:Step 1: DesignStep 2: Sign up to publishStep 3: SuccessCanva’s homepage hasn’t changed much over the years. This was their homepage in 2015:The look has changed, but the overall strategy and messaging haven’t.These homepages provide very little information around the product — the only information you can find on the company is from vague statements like “The easiest to use design program in the world” “10 million people designing on Canva” and “Design anything. Publish anywhere“.All are great statements – when there’s enough context – but by themselves they are almost meaningless. Because there’s no more information on the page, it suggests that the user needs to have context around the product BEFORE they get to this page (otherwise no one will sign up).Which is likely when you consider the paths people take to get to this page:Branded traffic and direct traffic — these people know what Canva is, and what you can do with it. They either want to learn more about the product (in which case they’ll navigate to the correct page), sign up, or log in.Or through the various conversion paths on the website which explores the specific functionalities and jobs that you can accomplish using the product.Because of these factors, there’s no immediate need to go in-depth with a sales pitch.Product PageThe majority of the ads that Canva runs goes toa product pagethat targets cold traffic:However, if you have visited their website before, that page will dynamically switch to this page instead:This warm traffic page is not very different from the cold traffic page. It simply shows the pricing table in the second section, which will be more relevant to people who already know a lot about Canva as they are more likely to be ready to sign up.Everything else is almost the same, so let’s take a look at the cold traffic version page.Value proposition (headline)The value proposition is arguably the most important part of any page. It’s the first thing you see after landing on a page, and it provides the context you need to instantly understand if the product does what you need it to do.This landing page has a relatively strong value proposition:It answers the 3 critical questions that someone first asks themselves when they visit a page:What is this?CanvaHow does it help me?Design anything in minutesWhat makes it better than the alternatives?1000’s of templates and images.It’s short, value-focused, and demonstrates a tangible outcome. But it also uses a fewdirect response marketing principlesto create a compelling hook:A primary promise:Design anything in minutesA perceived differentiator:1,000’s of beautiful templatesAn interesting element:Your secret weaponCrush objections:Try for FREE. Cancel anytimeThere can definitely be improvements to this value proposition (like adding in an emotional component), but the combination of the 4 elements above makes it captivating and interesting enough for you towantto continue reading.Messaging hierarchyA web page should present a story as to why the visitor should take the action you want them to take.The outline of this story is your messaging hierarchy, which consists of 3 elements:whatyou say (message),whento say it (order), andwhereyou say it on the page (layout). Only after you know your hierarchy should you focus onhowyou say it (text).This landing page has a very simple messaging hierarchy.Section 1:Value proposition:—Design anything in minutes with thousands of beautiful templates and images. Try Canva Pro FREE for 30 days. Cancel anytime.Section 2:Canva’s advantages, benefits, and how it works —Canva Pro is the design software that makes design simple, convenient, and reliable—create what you need in no time!Section 3:Pricing—Choose your plan and try for free for 30 days.Section 4:Important features you may enjoy— Time-saving, money-making tools. Problem: Don’t waste time with confusing tools. Solution: Canva Pro is simple, convenient, and reliable. (4-column feature grid)Section 5:Social proof (testimonials)Section 6:FAQsSection 7:Social proof (who else is using Canva Pro)This hierarchy isn’t super strong – which is fine because Canva has a freemium acquisition model and a product that is easy to activate in. It doesn’t show them how they can designanythingin minutes because it only takes seconds to sign up and try it.All it does it tell you the benefits of each feature.However, the biggest weapon in a marketers’ inventory is your customers’ imagination— with a product as simple, versatile and visual as Canva, getting the reader toimaginethemselvesdesigning anything they want should be easy.Here are 4 other ideas they could try:A more explicit and visual story arc for the page (Value proposition > social proof > big competitive advantage > how you see success in the product > features & benefits > social proof > CTA > FAQ)Explicitly laddering out how you’d see success in the product, with visuals for each step (example: 1. Choose a template. 2. Design anything. 3. Publish your design anywhere)Showcasing the relevant features underneath each of the steps outlined aboveAdding a design row on the page to push people into the product:Those changes would evidently make the page longer, but it’ll create a much clearer showcase for the product’s value.Design and layoutThe Pro landing page uses a similar visual strategy as the rest of the site:The use of multiple vibrant, yet not-overly powerful colors gives the page a cheerful, energetic and hopeful feel – all emotions that the reader wants to feel during this decision making process.These colors, combined with the shapes, patterns and image selection, helps implicitly communicate values like creativity, individualism, and fun.All are values that align with the creative process which Canva facilitates.But whereas this page excels at colours and emotional design, it doesn’t stick to best practice principles.Rather than sections with a single big, beautiful and clear image, accompanied by copy for each feature/benefit – which is a very scannable and common design pattern – they instead opt to use a 3-column, 2-row section:As a general rule, it’s good to be careful about having several columns or elements visible on the page at once.For example, a 3-column section could be similar to having 3-people trying to speak to you at once — it’s distracting and hard to choose who to focus on.Combine that distraction with the 6 extremely bold, bright, and visually captivating images in this section, and you could end up with a reader who has no idea what to look at, or read, first.With no clear message per section, you risk there being too much friction — it’s distracting, not scannable, steals focus away from the words, and somewhat fails at getting you towantto read the copy.That being said, I believe the images reflect the copy very strongly and, with Canva being a tool that allows you to build things to communicate visually, I think it works for the brand.They’ve taken a chance on not following best practices and, in my opinion, it’s turned out well!The real proof is in the numbers though, and only Canva can know how well this page converts (my guess is that it does pretty well).Key takeaway:Canva don’t necessarily adhere to best practice principles when designing web pages, but what they have built works well (visually). Their product page takes the user on a journey and is pretty compelling as a result.Paid SearchCanva takes a standard approach to Google Ads. Which is not a bad thing, because it’s likely effective.Through SEMRush, we identified that Canva uses 3 main keyword targeting strategies:Branded keywordsGoal keywordsSolution keywordsGoal campaignsA big part of Canva’s targeting strategy is goal-related keywords — keywords that narrow in on the goals that the user wants to accomplish. According toSEMrush, they’re targeting at least 270 goal-related keywords.Each of these keywords outlines a job that you can accomplish inside their product.Like creating business cards:The ad that Canva uses is incredibly simple.Headline 1—Make your own business cardA close variation of my search query to ensure that I know this result is relevant to my intentions, which helps it to stand out and will ensure the CTR is high, and the CPC is low.Headline 2—DIY your card in 3 easy stepsOutlines how easy I can make my business card: 3 steps. Fantastic. The headline also mentions DIY, which speaks to a quick and cheap solution. Just the kind of thing Canva was made for.Description—Pick a template, edit with more tools and photos, and download easily. Try free for 30 days!This expands on the 3 steps they mentioned in headline 2 (template, edit, download). It also reframes Canva as a product you have to pay for — this could weed out only people interested in a free product, and pre-qualify those ready to pay for a good service.Where they can improve:SitelinksThis feels like a lost opportunity for Canva as they link out to pages that aren’t relevant to user intentions. Instead, they should create ad group or campaign sitelinks that are tailored towards creating business cards, by either linking to thelanding pagethey use or to one of their other relevant pages, like aproduct pageor anadvertorial.Message matchingThe messaging in the ad is loosely relevant to the messaging on the landing page. It shows that I can design a business card (great), but it’s missing a critical message from the ad: “Create your card in 3 steps”.By clicking on the ad, you would expect a page thatgets youimagining yourself creating a business cardin 3 steps, not a page thatonlytalks about a product and its features.Mismatched ad / landing page messaging can decrease your ads quality scores – driving up cost per click – and also has the potential to increase visitor bounce rates.Why create a goal campaign?This strategy is perfect for Canva because it positions the product as a means for the user to accomplish their goals, or a way to solve their problems — which is fundamental to any purchase decision.Targeting keywords higher up in the funnel is also a great way to lower CPC costs:Solution:Business card marker |Goal:how to make business cardsGoal-related campaigns are often too high up in the funnel for a lot of businesses to target via Google Ads. That’s not because they’re ineffective – they can beveryeffective – but because they require a more comprehensive funnel, resulting in needing more resources to build them.When someone searches for a term like “How to create a business card”, this dictates that they haven’t found a lot of tools that can do it for them. They’re likely looking for information around how to accomplish that goal, which presents opportunities for tactics designed to guide people through the buyer’s journey, such as a lead-magnet and email sequence, a long-form sales page, or anadvertorialthat shows you how to create a business card inside of Canva.Yet, Canva doesn’t take this approach. Having a simple product, with a freemium acquisition model, they can get away with sending people to a short, product-focused landing page and still experience very high conversion rates:Solution campaignsCanva targets high-intent users with their solution campaigns. These campaigns target people who know what they want to accomplish, and have a pretty good idea of how they’re going to accomplish it: with software.These are high-value campaigns that focus on keywords that relate to a specific solution — often by adding nouns such assoftware, platform, tool, maker.For instance: Flyer MakerHeadline 1—Online Flyer MakerExplicitly mentions my core search term to ensure it’s relevant to me. They mention that it’s online, which also tells me about the mechanism of how I’ll make my flyer – through an online platform – to calm any concerns I may have regarding how I’ll make it.Headline 2—Make a flyer in minutesThis is great because it highlights that I can accomplish a lengthy and complex job in minutes. The key benefit here is saving time while aligning itself to the company vision.Description—Pick A Template, Edit With More Tools And Photos & Download Easily. Try Free For 30 Days!This description walks me through how easy it is to create a flyer (template, edit, download). This messaging appears throughout their website and on their ads for other campaigns.Once you click on the ad, you get taken to a very simple landing page that showcases their flyer templates.The landing page is good for the purpose it serves — driving visitors into the product by showing off the flyer templates.Though there is a lot they could have done to improve this campaign: they haven’t matched a lot of the messages from the ad onto the landing page. You don’t see any mention of designing a flyer in minutes, nor any mention of the 3 steps it takes to design a flyer.The page is good overall, but they could probably improve the conversion rate with a few small tweaks.Key takeaway:Canva use paid search at two different stages of the funnel very well. The ad copy does a great job of speaking to the search term as well as the unique benefits that their product brings. While the landing pages look great, they could be improved by having the page copy match the ad copy.Social media adsFacebook is one of Canva’s biggest channels. In this section, we’ll dissect the creative, copy, and overall messaging behind Canva’s social ads.Ad teardownThe team at Canva are testing a lot of different angles — not just the images or the copy, but alsohowthey communicate the overarching story they’re trying to convey.As expected, they havegreat, eye-catching visuals, and copy for their ads:But what stands out is that the majority of their ads focus on a single, core message:You can design anything, easily.It shows that they really understand the value that they bring to their audience. Let’s dive deeper into that.Facebook ad 1: On-brand designsImage:Ad imagery is possibly the most important part of a social media ad. It’s the part of the ad which is most likely to grab the attention of someone scrolling through their news feed.When looking through their ads, we noticed that many of their images in their ads follow a similar pattern: they have a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing image.And they contain a clear, snappy value proposition that narrows in on the singular jobs that a user is trying to accomplish.In this case:— Create strong on-brand designsBy adding some text to the image, you make the ad more eye-catching, while allowing the reader to instantly understand your core message by explicitly stating it.This ad also contains a screenshot of the app with a design template to showcase what you can design inside the product, and how easy the UI is to use (and in turn, the product functionality).However, there’s more to the marketing imagery than having a nice image while explicitly showing your product, and how it helps you. You need to consider the messages you implicitly communicate.Canva does this well.With warm and welcoming colors, it creates a perception that Canva is a friendly, authentic, and down-to-earth brand. The flowers in the background gives a tangible feel, and might be there to help implicitly communicate messages like art, individuality, and creativity.These are all messages that resonate with people who are looking for a product like Canva; they want to feel like they are able to let their creativity shine and make beautiful graphics — despite that traditionally being a tough and daunting process for most people who need marketing graphics.CopyYou need great copy in your ads, and Canva does this well. The copy is fun, concise, and most importantly, communicates that you can design what you need to in Canva.If we break it down further, Canva’s ad copy tends to focus on variations of the following core messages:The job you’re trying to do:Create strong on-brand collateralsThe benefit/advantage it gives you:Lock in your business’s imageHow you do it (Features + Canva Pro):Design templates and assets that your team can use anytimeFacebook ad 2: 30 day free trialImage:The use of friendly colors and fun shapes is designed to draw your attention while implicitly communicating codes like individualism, creativity, spontaneity, andease— all messages designed to appeal to creative types, as well as those who are frustrated by their current design process. This somewhat alleviates that frustration WITHOUT stating it:And this ad also contains an example design template – or screenshot of the app with a design template – to showcase what you can design with it, and how simplistic it is to use:Copy:I’m a big fan of the copy used in this ad. It’s concise, spaced out, easily readable, and outlines 3 different goals that you can accomplish with Canva:Speed up ad productionShare content to any platformResize designsIf you’re a marketer, these outcomes and jobs are no doubt very desirable for you — no one wants to wait a week for some ads to get back to you. This ad is likely to be targeting existing canva users in an effort to upgrade them and so the key selling points are different compared to the ads targeting cold traffic.Facebook Ad 3: Video adsVideo is a big part of their ad strategy, and it makes sense why;Canva is a tool where it’s biggest advantage comes from ease and speed.An image will find it hard to convey how fast or how easily you can create a brand guideline, a social media graphic, how someone transformed their entire design process — but a video will find it easy:Video:Canva uses a few video formats; walkthroughs, case studies, and product overviews. But what I found the most interesting is that they love tellings real stories with their ads:https://www.webprofits.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/Canva-Video-1.mp4This video brings in a real person, just like you and me, and shows how easily they solved one of their problems in order tomake someone else’s problems feel like your problems.At the end of the video, it tells you the solution to yournewlyrealised problem — all while demonstrating how easy and fast their product is to use.This is a classic and highly effective marketing tactic that’s great for targeting audiences who’ve yet to realise they have a problem that needs to be solved.Copy:The ad is well written and narrows in on 2 psychological triggers: ease and empowerment, in order to punch up the copy and connect with the readers on a deeper level.By tapping into ease with the message:Simplify your design process,they let the reader know they’ll save time and headaches.And by stating thatCanva enables YOU to create stunning designs,it shows that Canva empowers you by elevating your ability to design graphics.Regarding the copy structure, it becomes clear that they also use a similar structure to the ad we tore down above. Here’s how it goes:The job you’re trying to do:Create stunning designsThe benefit/advantage it gives you:Simplify your design processHow you do it:Canva enables YOU, from social posts to logos and presentationsKey takeaway:As you’d expect, Canva’s social media posts are visually brilliant, but that would only play a small part in their success. Their ad structure works well to convey their value proposition, and their experimenting of multiple messages and ad types ensures they are always optimising for the best results.Organic Search and SEOSEO is a huge channel for Canva!From smart onsite strategies, building entirely new databases and a lot of link building, it’s clear that they invest heavily in it.It’s a big operation for them — and it’s paying off. SEMrush estimates that Canva now gets over 5 million people visiting their website a month in the United States alone:And 40-60 million page views if you count their subdomains and logged in users:Every SEO strategy is based on 2 high-level functions: Offsite SEO, and technical SEO. (Content also plays a huge part but I’ve given that it’s own section).Offsite SEOCanva gets more than 50% of their traffic from branded terms.(USA traffic only. Branded accounts for over 50% of their traffic)Which may indicate that a lot of people who land on their website have heard about Canva from external sources like their friends or from other blogs.That becomes apparent when diving into Canva.com’s backlinks — they’ve spent a lot of resources acquiring external links to their website, almost all of them to their home page or their blog.They launched their blog in November 2014, and simultaneously got their first guest post articles up on the 15th November 2014:What stands out from most businesses – and what likely acted as abigcatalyst for growth – is that theyblanketedthe internet with guest posts from day 1.According to SEMrush, they published around 11 guest posts that day, with loads more in the following days afterward. This sudden influx of authority websites speaking about Canva would have exploded their brand awareness, website traffic, and domain authority.In the month after launching their blog, they had grown their backlink profile by 2,200 links:Since then, Canva has acquired over 10 MILLION backlinks (SEMrush).Technical SEOMost technical SEO analysis look at elements like URL structure, meta tags, heading tags and other elements for search visibility — this is all standard information. But what really makes Canva’s technical SEO strategy shine are the organic funnels they’ve created through keyword targeting and a Google-approved website structure.Regarding keyword targeting, Canva takes a similar approach to their Paid Search Strategy :Branded terms:Ranking for phrases that containCanvaSolution Terms:Ranking for phrases that describe their product, or functions of their product likePhoto EditororFree Stock PhotosGoal-related terms:Ranking for terms that describe things you can do in their product likeHow to make a logoAn integral part of Canva’s overarching growth strategy is helping the average person see success in all design-related functions.By diving into their website structure and search rankings, it’s clear that they don’t stray from this vision. They split up their main website into 4 core categories that centre around helping people be more successful designers — these target goal-related keywords:Design types:here’s how you can create [design type] in CanvaTemplates:easily make [design type] by importing these templates into CanvaPhotos:purchase these stock photos or import them into your Canva designsIcons:purchase these icons or import them into your Canva designsWe only want to show you the big user acquisition drivers, so we won’t talk about the Photos or Icon sections — those are more in tune with revenue expansion and product development, not user growth.Design typesGetting around250,000 visits a month(according to SEMrush), the ‘create’ section is a major acquisition engine for Canva. The majority of these pages rank highly — Canva’s design types (URL structure: canva.com/create/…) rank in the top 10 for their 30 highest-traffic keywords:Click here for their full sheet of keywords.And the vast majority of their pages are ranking in the top 3 spots. I’d make a safe bet that they’re acquiring a lot of users from this strategy.What makes these pages rank?Ranking high on Google is a result of exceptionally relevant, clear, and valuable experiences for the user. There are many factors that contribute to your rankings, but they all distill down to one thing: do users react well to the page?These pages contain well-thought-out content and a structure that is designed to walk the user through accomplishing their goal.We can illustrate this with theBusiness Card Makerpage:This page ranks in the top 10 for thekeywords:create business cards, business card design, make your own business cards— all very high traffic.And the page follows SEO best practices.The H1 headline communicates the benefit of using Canva to create posters, while containing the main keyword;business card maker.From there, the content walks you through a well thought out structure that answers basic questions, reads easily, inserts relevant keywords contextually, and is broken up into basicthematic subsections.The article has 961 backlinks with 261 referring domains, according to SEMrush. This makes it an authoritative page in the eyes of Google.How do these pages convert users?A lot of traffic is nice, but if it doesn’t convert, then it’s not contributing to your bottom line.So how does Canva convert this traffic? To answer that, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of prospect looking for a way to make posters.I’ll begin my search with a query:How to make a business cardAnd I’d end up with this search engine result page (SERP):Canva comes up as the 1st search result after Youtube videos and featured snippets — so naturally I’m going to read the description to see if it’s for me:Free business card maker?Yes that’s what I’m looking for.Design custom business cards in minutes?Awesome — now I know how long it’ll take me.And it’s rated 4.6 stars by 291 people?It must be pretty good.There’s no singular optimal formula for writing meta tags, but this search result is enticing and matches my needs, so it stands to reason that I’m going to click on it.I land on asales pagethatwalks me through how easy it is to create a business cardon Canva:Then if I click on the Call To Action:Start designing a business card, I’ll be taken to the signup page.And after a short registration process, Canva redirects me to the screen where I can create a business card:In 2 minutes (at most), Canva has helped me sign up and achieve success (self-activate) using the product.TemplatesCanva’s design templates are also a great acquisition engine for them, at an estimated280,000 pagevisits a month in the United States.They use a strategy similar to their design templates, the only difference is the mechanism of action — rather than written content, these visitors just they want to see a range of templates to choose from, so the growth team would have built a dynamic showcase page which automatically imports templates from the product database:These pages follow SEO best practices – Keyword in the H1, keyword in the introduction, and provides a clear user experience that makes it easy for someone to find a template that matches their needs.Key takeaway:Canva have implemented a very successful SEO strategy both technically and through links. They pushed for links from the first day that the blog went live, and have created pages that not only rank well for terms high up the funnel, but actually push visitors through the funnel and turns them into usersContent marketingThere’s no doubt in my mind that content drivesa lotof user growth and retention for Canva. It’s the 3rd pillar of their SEO strategy, but deserves its own section.Their content strategy is well planned out and executed — even after 100’s of blog posts, tutorials, and videos, Canva has rarely strayed from the path of helping people succeed with design.What’s important to point out, is they don’t have much, if any, consideration-stage or gated-content on their website. This is common amongst product-led companies, as it’s often more effective to generate leads by pushing them straight to a free plan or a trial.When looking at their content efforts, we can chalk their success down to 3 areas:Blog structureArticle structureDesign schoolBlog structureCanva’s blog structure is incredibly clear, and immediately states their purpose: achieve your design goals.They dedicate specific pillar categories on their blog page to showcase 4 high-level use cases of their main product: Canva Pro.DesignMarketingBrandingPhotographyThe majority of Canva’s articles are awareness stage content, likeFree Minimalist Fonts, but many of them take it a step further and showcase how easily you can use the product to create designs inside the product, such as the articleStepping up Instagram Stories with Canva; a decision stage content piece.They choose content topics that are relevant to each pillar and the user’s interests – a very fundamental strategy – likeHow to launch a popular newsletter. But when investigating further, you’ll find almost all articles centre around the design elements of the topic. For instance, the articleYour ultimate guide to twitter marketingdoesn’t contain much information regarding marketing on twitter, it’s mostly about creating good twitter designs.Regardless of the topic, or if the article is awareness stage or conversion stage, one thing is certain – the content is always more relevant to using the product, rather than the general topic being discussed.Article structureFrom their content topics, it’s clear that the content team is focused on results. That means paid signups. And to a lesser extent; trial signups and free signups.This results-first attitude becomes even more prevalent when we read their articles — every page has 2 consistent elements:A sidebar Call To ActionAnd a call to action in the footerBoth of these are common elements on a blog that’s optimised for conversions. But what makes Canva stand out is their relentless use of advertorials.An advertorial is a sales-oriented informational piece. It’s often an article which heavily promotes a product with the intention of turning readers into customers.Most of their articles are advertorials.They don’t mess around — their team has purposely structured, and written, their articles in a way that’s not onlyvery informative (high quality), but in a way that gives them specific reasons to add inline call-to-actions within the posts:All their content topics help you do something, like market on Facebook better, choose better fonts and colour schemes, etc — essentially, they all help readers accomplish specific design goals.But then they take it a step further, and say:“Hey, our product also helps you accomplish [goal], check out this template and see for yourself”.A lot of businesses would find this too “salesy” but as Canva has a free product it’s not as much of an issue. It’s a great way to push their readers to take that next step, while still being contextually relevant to their interests.Key takeaway:Canva has created content that is not only search friendly, but provides a ton of valuable information to potential and existing users.

With a yearly income of nearly $4 million, Buffer managed to become one of the best platforms to schedule, analyze and create social media strategies on all social media websitesincluding Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn.What follows below is the reverse engineering of Buffer’s digital marketing strategy. We’ll try to uncover what strategy they used as a new startup and how they adapted it while growing their company and becoming a necessity for digital marketing agencies around the world.1. The BufferApp StoryJust like many other startups, the story starts in the college rooms of the United Kingdom, in which Leo Widrich and Joel Gascoigne set the building blocks of Buffer. Joel writes the code for the twitter scheduler and soon after that tells Leo about it. The idea seemed great to both Leo and Joel and so the partnership began. The marketing side of the business would fall in the hands Leo Widrich.Being new to marketing, Leo started using content marketing as a way to promote the business. Buffer focused on blogs and social media with its marketing efforts.The first step was to gain an audience and win some notoriety for their tool.Buffer was pitched to the top tech blogs like Mashable, TechCrunch but nobody wanted to write about them.Moreover, even blogs with a smaller audience declined to talk about the newly created tool.“Okay. Let’s set up the Buffer blog. Let’s write about interesting things that are in the social media space so people find it interesting […]”– Leo WidrichAs a result, Leo started to produce the content on his own and publish it on their newly created blog. During the first 10 months he wrote about Twitter, how to get more followers and how Twitter could be used for SEO purposes. He then started publishing with a frequency of 2-3 articles per month, but soon wrote 3-4 articles each week. After he produced some great pieces of content he reached out to other blogs and asked if their audience would be interested in similar articles.He started creating relationships. He gained their audience through guest blogging and after 10 months, Buffer had over 100,000 users.“We then, from the U.K., moved to Silicon Valley. Half a year later raised the seed round from some great angels in the Valley, and I dropped out of college. My parents weren’t very happy about it.” – Leo WidrichThe shift of the content strategy appeared when they integrated other social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn within their tool. Their content marketing turned away from Twitter and started writing content about social media marketing and its uses. They tackled topics such ashow to make Google plus work for youand what works best onFacebook. The biggest switch in content marketing tactics came with the publishing of thecontent marketing manifestoby Rand Fishkin. The manifesto pushed one thing:Instead of creating your content for potential customers, create it for influencers who are already reaching them.This switch in tactics was remarked on the Buffer blog. More business, more efficiency and overall more fun articles started appearing. Their average 250 tweets per article quadrupled and reached 1000 with this switch and their successful content strategies.They wanted to influence the influencers and they managed to do just that.Let’s take a more in-depth look at how their startup became a multi-million dollar business:2. The BufferApp SEO StrategyBuffer didn’t use a traditional form of link building in order to reach the success they encounter today. What they’ve done is pure organic growth through content marketing and growth hacking. In this chapter we’re going to reveal the SEO metrics related to the digital marketing strategy in which Buffer has engaged.2.1 Understanding the SEO VisibilityLooking at the data fromcognitiveSEO, we can see the result of a well executed long term strategy. A slow but steady growth in the seo visibility, and once it took off in June 2014, the growth was exponential. The visibility drop you can notice in September in the SEO Visibility was from a “hasty” switch from HTTP to HTTPS, together with a manual penalty received from Google. They have recovered quite quickly from it seems. Other than that, the growth was constant, and the recovery was quick. The increased SEO Visibility from June is owed to the switch in content marketing strategy and expanding the topics that Buffer usually wrote about till then.2.2 Digging the Alexa VisibilityThe Alexa rankings metric represents an estimate measure of a website’s rank, compared with others from the internet. In the Buffer case, the Alexa chart mirrors the one from the social visibility chapter, with a huge spike in June and the drop in ranks in the month of September.For their tool, which targets worldwide users, having a rank of 1,150 means they are really doing well. Once again wenotice the increase in global rank in June and I have to mention that not only the content marketing switch helped gain more visibility in the SERPs, but it also increased the Alexa ranks.It’s important to keep in mind that the Alexa Traffic tool can sometimes be way off in its results, as it gathers data only from the users using the Alexa toolbar.2.3 What Keywords Does Buffer Rank on?A characteristic of using content marketing to promote your business is ranking well for long and relevant keywords. As you can notice in the chart above, most of Buffer’s high ranking keywords are pointing to blog articles. This is a good metric to take note of when you want to follow the success of the content marketing strategy.The irrelevant keywords that appear in the chart are due to the site’s overall authority. Buffer’s authority increased and started ranking for keywords they weren’t necessarily focusing on. This just adds to the success of their content marketing strategy and allows them to spread their content to a wide variety of topics since the site’s authority is already established.2.4 A Mystic Google PenaltyScreenshot from open.bufferapp.com/august-content-report/The drop in SEO Visibility mentioned above came from a hastyswitchof their social blog from HTTP to HTTPS combined with a manual Google penalty. The decision to make the switch came after Googleannouncedthat they will take into consideration the security of the website and the use of HTTPS over HTTP. Their desire to quickly jump on the bandwagon led to some mistakes. Moreover, they didn’t catch the mistake just in time and they managed to lose a large portion of organic traffic. Buffer also received amanual penaltywarning in the Google Webmaster Tools but no further details were given about it.They did fix the issue with the HTTPS and mentioned that with the help ofJohn Mueller(Webmaster Trend Analyst at Google) and his team, Buffer also recovered from Google’s penalty.For the moment Google deems HTTPS as a lightweight ranking factor, affecting about 1% of the websites, but in the future we may expect the factor to become heavyweight.2.5 Link Building Strategy – Shady or Not?Looking at the backlink profile, Buffer seems like it’s not doing so well in terms of link health. Over 22% of links pointing back to it are unnatural. This could have caused a penalty from Google and a huge loss in organic traffic. The SEO Visibility chart did show a drop in rankings and it could have been from the manual penalty mentioned above together with the hasty switch from HTTP to HTTPS.The links are coming from the Buffer Widget and they are all pointing to the “/add” directory.Google did state that links inserted in widgets are a big no no, and that’s why our toolmarked the links as unnatural.We can assume that the links are from blogs which have social widgets installed on them.But that Page is NoIndexed by Robots.txt so No Influence on Rankings.We can see how they worked around another Google penalty. With the help of therobots.txtfile, Buffer asked Google and other web crawlers not to index that directory on their website. By doing so, Google won’t index the links and it will not consider the links to be unnatural. The Google penalty would have been triggered and their organic traffic would have hit rock bottom. Those lines in the robots.txt file really saved them.It was really smart of them to point the widget only to one directory on their website. This way, they could easily block the indexation of the directory in the robots.txt file.Link Building Strategy = Relationship BuildingLooking at the overall backlink profile, link gain velocity and overall SEO strategy, we can say that Buffer didn’t really use atraditionalLink Building Strategy. They seemed to understand that link building switched from hunting for links in web directories and blog post spam, the unnatural one, to a more organic strategy. They used a new link building mentality:Link Building Mentality – Create relevant & engaging content in order to build a reputation in the community, and get your site linked.3. What’s Their Content Marketing StrategyAfter we uncovered Buffer’s SEO strategy, we can notice that the overall marketing efforts for Buffer are focused on content marketing. In the following chapter we’ll take a more in-depth look at their content, its target and the behavior of Buffer’s readers.3.1 It All Started with Guest BloggingBuffer’s content strategy started with a few posts on their blog and more social outreach to other high authority blogs and magazines. They used guest posting as a way to build awareness and authority for their own website, so that in the future, once they gained the trust of readers, they could focus more on their own website. In the chart above, we notice that today the main sources of links are from “blog posts or forum threads” and “short paragraph of text”. Buffer successfully managed to create conversations to build awareness for their application.3.2 Guest-posting to Buffer’s Blog Posting TransitionAfter they gained a lot of traction with guest blogging and starting online relationships, they focused more on their own blog. Buffer had huge success with their articles, especially on Twitter. Some of their blog posts reached more than 20,000 people. And to note is the fact that they reached the right people, relevant to their business.Nowadays their articles have an average of 4,000 twitter shares with an occasional spike of 7,000 or 8,000. They managed to create a “social following”, a tribe that engages with Buffer at every article they write.3.3 Number of Authors and Post FrequencyFinding out the exact number of authors who wrote on a website can be easily done with a simple Google query.Using the “site:blog.bufferapp.com/author-“intitle:page” query, the SERPs will display all the pages in the author directory.As mentioned in the introduction, for the first 10 months it was only Leo Widrich, the co-founder of Buffer, who wrote on the blog. As they grew more and more and reached a larger audience, more writers were co-opted for their business. We managed to find that45 writersblogged for Buffer. These ones certainly helped to produce great pieces of content and expand the Buffer audience.Seeing the evolution of the blog through time, we can notice thefrequencyof posting has increased significantly. In the first 10 months the Buffer blog published an average of 2-3 articles each week. Next it increased to 4-5 each week and nowadays they publish almost daily. And this is only on their own blog. Leo Widrichstatedthat in the first nine months he wrote around 350 articles, 3 to 4 articles each day, and tried to get them published on different websites.3.4 What Kind of Content Does Buffer PublishThe types of content published on the buffer blog also changed as time went on. It had two important switches throughout time. I did mention above that initially the blog content focused on articles about Twitter. Being a Twitter scheduler app it was Buffer’s way of creating a reliable and relevant tribe.The first switch appeared with the integration of Facebook and LinkedIn in the scheduler. The blog focused then on a variety of topics from the social media world. This isn’t to say that other Twitter articles weren’t published, but the authors also tackled some business development and growth on social media topics as well.The last content switch happened with the publication of the Content Marketing Manifesto. This made Buffer’s writers to target influencers also, rather than only relevant users. The topics now were more focused on business, psychology and overall light topics. This quadrupled the social response, articles that usually averaged 250 twitter shares, managed to reach 1,000.3.5 What Kind of Content Works Best for BufferIn each business segment it’s best to tailor the content to fit a certain persona. Once this is achieved, further tweaks and adjustments can be added to make the content fit each of the main social platforms. Let’s take a look at what kind of content works for each social platform for Buffer:For TwitterThe most shared articles on twitter are:The Science of Colors in Marketing Why is Facebook Blue– with over 16800 twitter shares. An in-depth article with more than 1300 words written by Leo Widrich.  The article is rich in studies about established brands, color psychology anda/b testing.The Ideal Length of Everything Online According to Science– around 13000 twitter shares. Another in-depth article written by Kevan Lee, in which he lists the perfect length for posts on each important social media platform.Free Image Source List– around 7000 twitter shares. Announcement article for a free tool made by the Buffer team.10 Scientifically Proven Ways to Make Yourself Happier–  around 7000 twitter shares. One of the articles that appeared after the switch to content that targets influencers.We can extract from these data the fact that in-depth analysis articles do really well on Twitter.Let’s take a look at what content works best for Facebook:The best 4 Facebook articles are:The Science of Colors in Marketing Why is Facebook Blue– Around 14,000 Facebook shares. The same article that leads the activity on the Twitter platform worked best for Facebook too.Science of Side Projects– With almost 6,500 Facebook shares. An in-depth article presenting how hobbies and side projects can improve overall performance.The Journey from ‘Crafters’ to ‘Traction’: Buffer’s October Marketing Report– Around 5,000 Facebook shares. Marketing report, detailing the status of Buffer’s marketing efforts in the months of September and October.Recent Twitter Facebook Changes– With 3700 Facebook shares. In depth article about Twitter and Facebook changes.We can see that for Buffer’s market, the same in-depth content that works on Twitter, also works well on Facebook.We can start to draw a conclusion but let’s analyze the Google Plus activity before it:The best 4 Google Plus articles are:The Science of Colors in Marketing Why is Facebook Blue– This article had close to 4,000 Google Plus Shares. The same article that leads the activity on Twitter and FacebookThe Ideal Length of Everything Online According to Science– Around 3,000 Google Plus shares. An in-depth article presenting how hobbies and side projects can improve overall performance.22 Tips To Better Care for Introverts and Extroverts– With 3,500 Google Plus shares.A very successful in-depth article on Google plus platform and not on many others.Free Image Source List– With 3,000 Google Plus shares, this article is announcing a free tool made by the Buffer team.In-depth and long articles work really well for Google Plus too. They clearly have found what their audience was looking for and know how to use that.The overall conclusion for what kind of content works for Buffer is that long and in-depth well researched articles generated more traction on the social media platforms.There isn’t too much of a difference between the behavior of the fans on different social media platforms, they all enjoy reading and sharing the same content. A fact that is also clear to see in the chart above which shows the overall social media activity on Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus combined.3.6 Social Signals vs. Links CorrelationWhen a company engages in a content marketing strategy it has a variety of metrics to follow: the social traction a piece of content generates, the amount of backlinks the articles produce and even the comments produced for each piece. Each of these metrics is worth following individually but when you have multiple data points from each one you can study how they correlate on each social platform.Let me first explain what the charts below represent. It’s a correlation between the social media activity for a blog post and the amount of links pointing to that article. It’s a very important metric to study in order to find out if the increased social sharing leads to gaining more backlinks for the website. The data are also used to see which type of content generates more backlinks and which type of content generates the most traction in social media.On the following chart, the dots represent each article shared through Twitter, and on the x axis the amount of referring domains that particular article is linked from. Let’s study the Twitter share vs. referring domains first:The graph shows a moderate positive correlation between the number of tweets and referring domains, meaning that a large amount of Twitter shares will lead to a large number of referring domains gained. Let’s look further at the Facebook activity and see if the social activity there will lead to more backlinks:Even if there is not such a strong correlation between the Facebook activity and the number of referring domains, a large amount of sharing will still result in a large amount of referring domains gained.The same can be said here, for Google Plus. Just like the other social media platforms, the large amount of shares on Google Plus will lead to a large number of referring domains.Overall we didn’t notice one social media standing out too much from the other for the correlation between social shares and referring domains gain. Twitter seems to take the lead in terms of social share to referring domains gain, but only by a small amount. Buffer continues to use them all at the same intensity, since neither one of them will generate more backlinks than the other.4. Growth Hacking Strategy – Tricks UsedFor every startup, including Buffer, getting the name out there and creating a user and fan base is one of the most difficult challenges. In order to compete with established brands through traditional methods it will take a lot of effort and the results will appear late. Buffer knew this and they got creative with their growth strategy.Studying theVisual Link Explorerchart, it seems clear which market Buffer targeted. Let’s take a closer look to see exactly which niches provided the best results for their marketing efforts.4.1 The Most Important Niches That Use BufferappIn order to figure out the growth strategy for Buffer we have to take a look at which category of websites link back to the app. Let’s try to find out which niches worked best for Buffer:The chart displays the niches that use the Bufferapp widget. It seems that there is a lot of use of the tool in the business and tech blogs.Accordingto Google, these two categories represent a total of 2 million blogs online at this moment. This growth strategy is all about focusing on those categories in which a large deal of influencers lie. Once they have been reached and converted, the growth of Buffer was almost exponential as we saw in the Social Visibility chart.4.2 Freemium ModelThe next growth strategy used by Buffer was theFremium business model. This strategy is described as offering the service free of charge, but with a cost (premium) for extra features and functionality. It’s a great and easy way to implement growth hacking strategy since it makes the tool its own advertising platform. To clear this out, the more users use the tool, the more see it and, in turn, will use it and so on. Among the free users, many will find use of the premium features on the tool, and will pay for the extra functionality it provides. This worked great for them since the buffer app appeared on the users blogs and websites generating more awareness for the tool.4.3 The Buffer Blog Widget –  A Neat Growth Hacking TrickNerdyData’s data provide some interesting insights, by searching for the buffer add button code in their search engine, the tool uncovered almost 3,000 websites in its database. So 3,000 websites which have the bufferapp, and which have a link pointing back to the buffer page. That’s one way to build unnatural links, but as mentioned above, they used the robots.txt file to disable GoogleBot from indexing the directory the link is pointing to.Let’s take a look at how that reflected in the link gain velocity:After introducing the link into their widget, Buffer received a huge increase in their monthly link velocity. We can track in thebacklink explorerexactly how many websites add their app each month.4.4 Growth Hacking Idea – An Internal Traffic Booster both for Them and OthersOne other interesting growth hacking strategy that they use is done with the help of the suggestion tab in their tool. The suggestion tab does exactly what it says, that is to offer a variety of articles that have been shared on that day and in that industry. Having their content strategy tackle many other topics, besides social media and business, Buffer is able to promote its own blog posts inside their own tool and still be relevant to the industry the user is in.Take a look at how it works. The user checks what content is recommended for him, filters the topics and picks what’s interesting to the users’ fan base. Most of the time, you will be able to find a Buffer blog post in the suggestion boxes. It’s an interesting and creative way to promote their own business, with the help of the tool they are marketing.Inception – Buffer helps Buffer promote itself!An extra incentive to install the Bufferapp on your website is the fact that only this way you’ll have your content available in the suggestions section of the app.4.5 API and Data Integrations as Growth Hacking ToolsWhat’s important to understand when using or creating an API is to make it in such a way that when it is used to build widgets or other apps, it will automatically bring more content into its own network. The API is there to make the core service, in this case the bufferapp, stickier to the users, even though it’s used through a third party software. Buffer’s API is very focused towards the end user, the developer in this case, and it provides him with a full documentation and tools needed for a more easy integration of the bufferapp within its newly developed app or widget.By using the API as a growth hacking strategy, Buffer enabled other developers to make their own marketshare, use the bufferapp. And since the Bufferapp’s success is determined by the number of users who are active, they managed not only to get more people to use its core service, but also increased the overall size of the marketplace.ConclusionBuffer’s success is owed to a well established marketing strategy of making content that is great, engaging, and most of all, worth sharing. They managed to create a tribe that engages with them on all social platforms and is eager to reply and share each new piece of quality content that they deliver. Buffer managed to find the right combination of content marketing, growth hacking and together with a really good product they became an almost irreplaceable tool.They understood that marketing results will not provide overnight success and chose a natural way to grow their business. They owe most of their success to a great content marketing strategy.What we want you to take from this article is the following:Focus on building great, engaging and shareable content.If your content is great, it will gain its own links naturally.Reach out and engage with influencers, since they can bring their own tribe to your product.Have patience and remember that you are engaged in a long term plan. Don’t expect results overnight!Always test out new content pieces. See what works best for your readers, and what works best for each social media platform.Get as creative as you can with the growth hacking strategies. Try to make your product stick and be hard to replace for the end user.What other facts can you extract from the Buffer’s success analysis?

Before Slack, Butterfield was well-known as the founder of the photo sharing platform, Flickr.As expected, Butterfield had the benefit of a lot of contacts, including those in the media, that he could leverage to get the word out.But this doesn’t mean you can’t replicate a lot of what Butterfield did to generate product hypeandget feedback to make your product the best it can be. Butterfield followed a 4-step sequence.Step 1: Once you have a workable product, convince everyone you know to try it out (for free, of course) and give you customer feedback.As Butterfield recalls in an interview, just a few months before Slack’s beta release in May 2013, he said, “We begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback. We had maybe six to ten companies to start with that we found this way.”[3]Slack’s goal with this was to iron out any issuesbeforetheir product hit the market while also starting to generate some awareness. Plus, this gave Slack their first few testimonials from Medium, Rdio, TGC and Cozy.Here is the first version of the Slack website on Aug 19, 2013 with testimonials from Butterfield’s friends at other companies:Step 2: Find an interesting “hook” that’ll help you spread the word...and then make sure it keeps spreading.Slack could have gotten a lot of awareness just by leveraging Butterfield’s fame. But they moved beyond that to create an interesting hook (and this hook is exactly what you should focus on if you don’t have someone famous onboard).The hook was: Slack is out to “kill email.”Basically everyone finds email annoying. So, making this the “hook” was a great way for Slack to grab people’s attention.Just look at the titles of some articles that were written about Slack pre-launch:“Flickr founder plans to kill company e-mails with Slack” (CNET)“The Co-Founder Of Flickr Wants to Replace Email At The Office” (BI)“Flickr Cofounders Launch Slack, An Email Killer” (FC)Once you have that hook,don’tunderestimate the power of traditional media in getting it out there. Pull all the strings you can.For some more inspiration, check out Sumo’s easy two-step process for getting media coveragehere.And once you’ve got that media coverage, make sure it doesn’t fall flat.According to Butterfield, just getting the articles published is only 20% of the key to media success.“The other 80% is people posting about that article. I almost never go to news sites–it’s overwhelming how much content is out there. But I will pay attention to what my friends are picking up and sharing.”In other words, don’t let your article die a sad, slow death just because it wasn’t reshared. Promote your content on social media, community forums and places you’ve never thought of toget more traffic.Step 3: Invite people to try out your preview release.Slack’s initial request for feedback and successful media blitz worked - in August, 2013 Slack gave people the chance to request invites to try out their preview release… and 8,000 people did so on the very first day.Two weeks later, that number had almost doubled.[4]Golden Nugget: Even if your product is in beta, don’t call it that. As Butterfield says, “that was essentially our beta release, but we didn’t want to call it a beta because then people would think that the service would be flaky or unreliable.” Slack called it a “preview release” instead.Milk this beta-testing period for all its worth. Butterfield says, “beta-tester feedback is crucial to finding those little oversights in a product design.”In other words, this is your chance to get feedback and make your product something people will absolutely love by the time you launch it.And the more people love your product? The more people that’ll be talking about it (to get you that viral word-of-mouth marketing growth).Step 4: Launch your product to the public!After you’ve finished your testing period and managed to generate some awareness, open up your product to the public. (Slack did this 6 months after their preview release in February, 2014.)Slack continues to rely heavily on word-of-mouth marketing and on brand building to generate organic views to their website.Here is a breakdown of the 108,600,000 website visitors Slack generates today:This is Slack’s public facing main site. As you can see, the majority of Slack’s traffic comes from direct sources… meaning 91.35% of those 108.6 million monthly visitors are going to the website directly (BTW: 108M+ monthly visitors is 5x HubSpot’s 20M+).But given that Slack has 4+ million daily active users, a very high percentage are users heading to the website to login.This high amount of direct traffic can also be attributed to that ultra-powerful word-of-mouth awareness that Slack worked so hard for from December 2012 up until February 2014.In other words, since so many people already know Slack by name, they just type Slack.com directly into the browser.Here are the keywords that really bring the most amount of traffic to Slack:Slack's Referral Traffic [Source]What sticks out to you? The word ‘Slack’ shows up in every single one!Even the 5th organic keyword is just the word “Slack” in Japanese. Japan is Slack’s biggest market outside the United States (see proof below).Slack’s traffic profile by countrySlack’s other top keywords, beyond the branded ones, usually relate directly to their product offering (ie: messaging, team communication, etc).This all goes back to Slack’s awesome word-of-mouth brand awareness. Because of it, Slack doesn’t put huge amounts of focus on content marketing or their SEO - their brand name and product offerings do a lot of the work for them.The takeaway: Noah said it best in this Tweet...The secret to marketing is.... Build a great product.— noah kagan (@noahkagan)January 9, 2017Slack didn’t do this overnight like most people think. They started building the product in December, 2012 based on their own pain point, begged friends to use the product in May 2013, preview released the product in August 2013 and officially launched to the public in February 2014.14 months of hard work to generate 8,000 new wallet-ready customers in 1 day.P.S.

Though Slack have amassed a lot of followers on Facebook, it seems they use Facebook primarily as a tool to get readers elsewhere.To start, their cover photo isn’t used to promote Slack itself, but to drive people to their podcast:And their pinned post of at the top of the page directs fans to other methods of contact (in other words, they are trying to pull communications off of Facebook and onto other platforms):YouTube is Slack’s next biggest source of social media traffic and from what I can tell, it is Slack’s #1 social customer acquisition channel. It pulls in approximately 155,000 visitors monthly.Slack’s YouTube channel is a combination of general Slack content, tutorials, and case studies.But if you sort Slack’s videos by the most popular, you’ll notice that the best performing videos fall into a different category; namely, they are TV ads that Slack actually ran.Repurposing these successful TV ads as YouTube video content has worked extremely well with the top video claiming more than 15,000,000 views.Plus, the clever folks at Slack knew just how to get those who enjoyed the video interested enough to click on Slack’s website: a CTA that goes to Slack’s website butdoesn’tmake any mention of what Slack actually is.Since YouTube has such a wide-ranging audience, many of whom might not know what Slack does, this was a great way to generate further interest and entice viewers to click.If they had mentioned in the CTA screen that they were a messaging app, likely many people wouldn’t have bothered to click through because they wouldn’t think this was a company relevant to them.Also, notice the unique tracking URL Slack is using to measure their traffic from this video campaign. It is easy to remember and redirects to their homepage (when you see “slack.com/animals” you get curious and want to know what it’s all about).Slack is using a direct response marketing tactic called the“curiosity-gap”to get TV viewers to stop what they’re doing and visit their website, and to also get more clicks on YouTube.(P.S.

In fact, Twitter has actually been Slack’s most important social media platform.Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield said:“We bet heavily on Twitter. Even if someone is incredibly enthusiastic about a product, literal word-of-mouth will only get to a handful of people - but if someone tweets about us, it can be seen by hundreds, even thousands.”In other words, Twitter played a huge role in Slack’s viral word-of-mouth growth. Slack’sWall of Loveis a perfect example of this.[5]People can tweet to @SlackLoveTweets to show their expression of love for Slack.As for Slack’s tweets themselves, they’ve helped Slack out in a few different ways:They helped Slack build brand awareness and define their company’s voice (a voice that’s been so distinctive, they even wrote a Medium article about it).[6]They help Slack keep their users up-to-date on changes and improvements.They give Slack a venue for getting customer feedback and communicating with customers.Twitter as a venue for customer communication has been HUGE for Slack. They rely heavily on Twitter for dealing with customer support issues and getting customer feedback.Today, Slack’s customer support team has 18 people alone with a group of 6 making sure Twitter is covered 24/7.What Slack’s use of social media should teach you is this: social media is about a lot more than just driving traffic and getting clicks. It also gives you the chance to connect with your customers and help make your brand memorable.The takeaway: When it comes to social media, you need a different strategy for each social media platform (side note: this is also exactly whatTony Robbins doesto get such massive engagement and followers across his social media platforms). Slack leverages each platform in the following ways:Facebook: to update fans on their blog articles, podcast, event and places they've been featured.YouTube: to drive customer acquisition with professionally produced product videos and smart direct response calls-to-action.Twitter: to drive viral word of mouth awareness with 24/7 customer support.[Tip #3] Sponsor Every Podcast In Your Niche. Cut The Losers. Keep The Winners.Slack is very familiar with the podcasting world.Before creating their own podcast, Slack dabbled (a lot) in sponsoring podcasts. Slack’s first CMO, Bill Macaitis, made them an instant marketing priority.In just a matter of time, Slack was sponsoring about 10 podcasts of all very different audiences. These included Startup (a podcast for entrepreneurs), Reply All (a podcast about the internet) and 99% Invisible (a design podcast).The key here isn’t necessarily sponsoring podcasts that have monster audiences (although this obviously helps) but sponsoring ones that have loyal audiences that regularly interact with and trust the podcast host.Beyond this, Slack has also branched out into creating two very distinctive podcasts of their own.The first of these was a series called “The Slack Variety Pack” podcast.The podcast itself was pretty weird and offered a very unique voice in a sea of podcasts with repackaged business advice.Slack’s SoundCloud page explained it best: “Think of it asThis American LifemeetsOffice SpacemeetsMonty Python’s Flying Circus.”Obviously, the podcast resonated with the audience as there were nearly 2 million listens over the course of 15 episodes.[7]But perhaps the most important thing to take note of is how Slack used this podcast to promote themselveswithoutsounding like a sleazy hard sell. As Macaitis explains, the best podcasts “aren’t trying to sell you something.”And it looks like Slack found just the right balance. There are 3 sneaky podcast promotion techniques Slack is using:Slack’s podcast promotion technique #1:Beginning each episode with a quick announcement that the podcast content is “brought to you by Slack” and asking them to visit Slack.com to “change your working life forever.”Slack’s podcast promotion technique #2:Integrating non-salesy CTAs following specific podcast stories (such as asking people to tweet their own stories to @SlackHQ for a chance to be featured on the podcast after the hosts discussed a crazy office story).Slack’s podcast promotion technique #3:Inviting listeners to share their thoughts and feedback with #SlackVarietyPack at the end of each podcast.The Slack Variety Packmay be finished, but Slack now has another new podcast that uses similar promotional tactics.Golden Nugget: Instead of just writing up a transcript for each podcast episode like most companies do, Slack repurposes the content of each podcast to make a Medium article and get more exposure. Each Medium article begins with the full embedded podcast episode and a short reminder that their podcast exists.The takeaway: Find podcasts that your potential audience members are listening to and see if you can become a sponsor (since Slack has a really big audience, they sponsored a lot of different types of podcasts to test which work). It’s an upfront investment, but as you track what works you can cut the losers and keep the winners.If you want tostart your own podcastand get it to grow… be different. You need to be known for something (Slack does this by running an entertaining podcast about the meaning and identity we find in work).[Tip #4] Rank For Competitive Short Tail Keywords With This Category Leader Business Review StrategySlack has another organic traffic trick up their sleeves that you’re going to want to follow: they get themselves on review and comparison websites.This means that people typing in more generic product search terms still find them.Take a look at what happens when I search “team collaboration software”.Obviously, Slack’s #1 slot under Google’s “software” bar at the top is going to help. But moving beyond that, all 3 of the top organic listings are review websites and comparison articles.Golden Nugget: If Slack wanted to, they could compete for this keyword phrase by writing an in-depth comparative guide on the best team collaboration software. Then, they could collect reviews. You can try the same for your SaaS.But keep in mind that creating content that outranks a big review/directory/comparison website will be tough, since they already have so much user generated content.Luckily, Slack made the cut and shows up for anyone who clicks the first PC Mag link (so they didn’t need to resort to that nugget above):But of all the review websites listed above, G2 Crowd is the most interesting (and we’ll tell you how you can make it work for you in just a second).Slack is absolutely dominating on G2 Crowd. Of the 10,000 products reviewed on the platform, Slack has the highest number of reviews. (4,043 reviews in total!)And they are one of the top performers on G2 Crowd’s crowdsourced “Grid”:I got in touch with Godard Abel, co-founder and executive chairman of G2 Crowd, to get some more intel.When I asked him why 4,043 people chose to put their Slack reviews on G2 Crowd and not some other random review platform, this is what he had to say:And as Godard explains, Slack has seen some BIG payoffs by ranking so highly in G2 Crowd:Obviously, that’s alotof new visitors checking out Slack’s positive reviews. Some may be current customers coming to join in on the conversation. But plenty of others will be brand new prospects browsing reviews before making their purchase.And you can bet, it’ll be hard for them to choose any other productbutSlack after checking out Slack’s successful G2 Crowd profile.How can you make sure people leave a review for you on G2 Crowd and other review sites?This is what has worked for Slack, according to Godard:As Godard says, this is hard to replicate. But to start, you need to make sure your product is signed up for all the top review sites relevant to your type of product. Otherwise, you’ll never get people leaving those reviews.Just google “top review websites for (your type of product)” to find out what those are.If you’re in SaaS, you’re going to want your product listed on places like G2 Crowd, Capterra, and GetApp.Once your product is listed, you can give your customers some incentives to get those reviews rolling in (you’ll probably have to do a bit of experimentation to see which review platform makes sense for you to focus on).One way you can do this is with an email campaign offering some sort of bonus. G2 Crowd uses a 3-step email campaign that offers Amazon giftcards to get the first 10-20 reviews:Whether you do this via a subscription or on your own, you can find other ways to incentivise customers to leave reviews - whether that’s with gift cards, discounts or small freebies. Here is another example:Golden Nugget: Use popup CTAs and welcome mat CTAs on your customer login pages to collect customer reviews.I used the freeSumo List Builder Popup CTAin the example above. Just make sure you don’t ever design any of your popups to look likethis.The takeaway: Get yourself onto top review websites as much as you can. Then, set up an email campaign, popup CTA or welcome mat CTA to tell your customers that you will reward them for leaving a review (Slack does this with their G2 Crowd review page that generates them 4,542 visitors).What if you don’t have the same level of brand awareness as Slack to pull off a top category ranking on a review site? Then make sure you nail your SEO and get yourself up in search engine ranking.

Referrals make up 3.34% of Slack’s total traffic, and here are Slack’s top 5 referrers:Of all these referrers, the second and third are the most interesting: GitHub and Trello.As we just discussed above, Slack has a ton of integrations. And two of these are - you guessed it - GitHub and Trello.If I click on the GitHub link in that referral image above, I end up on a GitHub page explaining how Slack and GitHub can be integrated.And if I click the Trello link, I end up on a similar integration page on Trello’s website:At first glance, it might not seem like the clicks from these two referrals are all that significant. After all, combining these GitHub and Trello pages only account for 9.84% of all referral traffic… and referral traffic only brings 3.34% of Slack’s total traffic.But even though these percentages may seem small, you first need to take into account the sheer number of visitors to Slack every month - 108.6 million!And if you consider the percentages above out of Slack’s total monthly visitors, the numbers actually look pretty good.GitHub alone brings Slack approximately 200,000+ clicks monthly and Trello brings them 150,000+.Not bad for something Slack doesn’t really have to do much for.Just one strategic integration is part of what helped YouTube get so big, so fast (and we also found strategic integrations to play a super important role in ourShopify growth study).Back when YouTube first began in 2005 as an unknown company, they integrated with MySpace, thus tapping into the 25 million unique users MySpace had at the time…withouthaving to seek these visitors out themselves.Essentially, integrations let you piggyback off the success of another platform.Slack has 1,000+ integrations (231 alone just in Bots apps) - meaning they are reaping A LOT of benefits and extra traffic because of them.And of course, the 4th referrer is Slack’s Medium publication. Their Medium publication brings an extra 76,063 interested visitors to their main site every month.Click here to reveal the tool Slack use to turn their anonymous referral traffic into full company profilesOn that note, let’s move on to analyzing Slack’s Medium publication in the next tip.The takeaway: Identify the one product or service that your customers are already using and integrate/partner with them to piggyback off their success and drive new customers to your website (Slack does this with GitHub to generate 200,000 clicks per month and with Trello to generate 150,000 clicks per month).[Tip #6] The Top 4 Medium Blog Posts You Need To Get 500,000 Monthly Blog Visitors With Your Content Marketing Side-HustleSlackHQ.com, also calledSeveral People Are Typing - The Official Slack Blog, is Slack’s Medium publication.Here are the publication’s main traffic sources:Slack’s Medium publication is a combination of 4 main types of blog posts:Company and product updatesProduct tutorialsPractical workplace tipsPersonal storiesThis combination helps Slack:Generate an extra 70,000+ viewers to their main website monthlyKeep their current customers in-the-know or encourage potential prospects with Slack updates and improvementsBoost their search engine visibilityConnect with their readers (whether they are already users or not) and continue building their brand name with their unique customer voiceSounds like the perfect combination, doesn’t it? Let’s look at how they work in a bit more detail.Medium article type #1: Company and product updatesIf you look at Slack’s top performing Medium articles by social engagement, you’ll see that the first 3 all fit into this category.These type of articles are part brand awareness builders, part ensuring current customers know what’s changed and part attempting to impress new prospects.Take note of how Slack understands the importance of their own brand name: the 2nd and 3rd title actually begin with the word “Slack.”But just as important as the articles themselves are what the articles try to get readers to do.The calls-to-action (CTAs) on most of Slack’s Medium articles are a variation of opening up a dialogue with their customers by asking them to reach out with questions or suggestions.They alsoalwayslink to their Twitter page in the CTA (read tip #2 again if you need a reminder why).Medium article type #2: Product tutorialsSlack uses this type of article to pump up their SEO and get more people finding their Medium publication through search engines.If you look at the traffic profile above, you’ll see that the second largest traffic source is Search clocking in at 11.45%.And if you look at the organic search terms below, you can see that the top keywords are all branded.The most amount of organic traffic is coming from the keyword “slack blog”, but when you approach Slack’s main page, the link to the blog isn’t very obvious:This accounts for the high number of people searching for the phrase “slack blog”. (After all, what kind of big businessdoesn’thave a blog?)But beyond that, the middle 3 keyword phrases are customer search queries and questions about their product that Slack knew were common and thus decided to make articles about.Here are the 3 specific pages generating that traffic (as per the 2nd, 3rd and 4th top organic keywords on the SlackHQ Medium publication):slack bot tutorial:A beginner's guide to your first botslack meetings:Meetings that work (and don’t) in Slackslack status:Set your status in SlackIncluding these type of articles not only gets more people from search engines onto the publication, but also gives Slack a clever way to provide customers with more product info without just referring them to a boring “help” page.At the end of articles about product updates, the CTA often links readers to more product related information and gives a few links to other product updates they think their readers might like to know about.Medium article types #3 and #4: Practical workplace tips and personal storiesIt’s these two last types of articles that have let Slack perform so well on the Medium platform.Slack HQ's Referral Traffic [Source]Over 50% of the referring traffic to SlackHQ comes from Medium itself, as Slack has a strong Medium presence with over 125,000 followers and is featured first on the Medium Brands page.That page you can see pictured above accounts for 7.27% of SlackHQ’s referral traffic, but where is that top 47.54% of medium.com referral traffic actually coming from? Answer: Medium’s homepage in the ‘Popular On Medium’ section and the ‘Medium Daily Digest’ email.By really finding their voice and tapping into the type of personal and real-life articles that perform well on Medium (like articles with workplace tips and stories), Slack often finds itself on Medium’s ‘Popular On Medium’ section or featured in the Daily Digest email that Medium sends to its subscribers.For these types of articles, Slack often skips a CTA entirely. For this story-based article, the ending is just an image and blurb about the guest author.This is how you know that Slack isnotrelying on these types of articles just to sell. Instead, they are here to build their brand, show off their unique company voice and perform well within Medium (so they have max outreach).How can you do the same?Build your Medium following and publish articles that Medium’s algorithm loves(ie: high read ratio, high amount of recommends, high comment count, etc… basically everything that comes to you when you createreally good contentand follow the 4 types of blog articles above).One more thing to note is that Slack runs their blog solely on Medium and doesn’t have their own blog outside of it. More and more companies are doing this, finding Medium to be a great platform that can open them up to a whole new potential audience that they might not reach otherwise.The takeaway: Use articles on your blog to provide product updates, product tutorials, practical workplace tips and personal stories. Give them an interesting headline with your branding and don’t hide all of your product updates inside your company help desk (Slack does this by publishing these 4 types of content on their Medium publication).[Tip #7] The One Settings Cog You Can Change Inside Your Medium Publication To Get Over One Thousand Claps On Your First Medium ArticleIf you want to get more claps on your Medium articles than aTony RobbinsUnleash The Power Within event then do this...This is a quick little hack to up your Medium game that works for more established businesses. If you already have a pretty strong social media following, then this is an easy and powerful way to have instant Medium success.(But if you are “newer” to the biz world or don’t yet have much of a social media following, don’t worry! You can learn all about building up your Facebook following righthereand your Twitter following righthere.)Part of Slack’s major success with Medium is that they already had a large audience to market to.In fact, back when they began their publication in August 2014 with an article titled “11 Useful Tips for Getting the Most of Slack,” it was recommended 1,024 times… even though it was their first article ever!How did Slack manage to get this much engagement on their very first article? Well, one theory goes back to a feature that makes Medium an awesome marketing tool: it lets you bring your followers from another platform.In other words, if you sign up with Medium through either Twitter or Facebook, Medium will automatically import all of your followers that already have a Medium account.And as you’ll see in our social media analysis below, Twitter has been the backbone of a lot of Slack’s success and customer interaction.So, Slack probably leveraged this by signing up with Medium through their Twitter account to quickly reach their first 100,000 Medium followers.You can do this by connecting your Twitter handle inside your Medium Publication Settings:The takeaway: If you’re launching a new Medium publication, make sure it’s connected to your company’s Twitter or Facebook. This will give you the best chance of growing your Medium following and referral traffic to your website (Slack did this and got over 1,000 people to recommend their first Medium article).[Tip #8] The PPC Traffic Funnel Based On 3 Core Keywords You Can Swipe And Deploy In MinutesSlack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield has openly admitted that paid marketing hasn’t been his priority nor his main traffic driver for Slack.A tweet by Stewart Butterfield on Mar 16, 2016 [Source]Yet, paid marketing still plays a pretty big role in Slack’s success, accounting for nearly 400,000 website views monthly.These are the top performing ads for the 2,100 PPC keywords Slack is bidding on:As you can see, every single one of these ads has the word “Slack” and the word “Team.”Each headline also contains one of the following 3 words: “Communication,” “Collaboration,” or “Messaging.”The ad copy varies between benefit-driven (ie: fewer meetings, less internal email, all your tools integrated) and feature-driven (ie: real time messaging, file sharing, and powerful search).Clicking on any of the top performing ads will bring prospects to one of two places: Slack’s homepage or Slack’s product page.Here’s the entire paid search funnel for ads that direct prospects to the product page:As you can see, they are using a single landing page fora lotof different keywords.Usually, a company would create several different landing pages based on the searcher’s keyword intent. But this particular landing page must be working well enough for Slack that they can just direct all keywords here.(I’ll show you why this is a great landing page later in tip #9.)You can see that most of the keywords are some variation of “collaboration”, “messaging” or “communication.”Slack has the challenge (or the benefit, depending on how you look at it) of having to appeal to a wide audience.But clearly, Slack has found three words that seemed to have universal appeal, no matter the searcher.You’ll also see that there are a few competitor branded keywords (ie: “office 365 instant messaging”).As far as I could tell, Slack isn’t investing in retargeting ads. Per this discussion in 2015, they weren’t. And I haven’t found anything implying they are now:A tweet by SlackHQ on Mar 19, 2015 [Source]In general, it’s safe to say that Slack’s focus with their advertising has been more on brand building than anything else. This means they’ve also experimented with some more ‘traditional’ forms of advertising to help get their name out:A tweet by a Slack Account Executive on May 22, 2017 [Source]One of Slack’s most memorable ventures into traditional advertising happened when they took out a full-page ad in the New York Times. This ad served as a challenge to Microsoft, who was soon to launch their own competing product.A tweet by Stewart Butterfield on Nov 2, 2016 [Source]Slack then sensibly published the whole ad on their Medium publication, thus providing them yet another outlet to get their name out and spread the word. Clearly, it worked.If you look back to our analysis of their top performing Medium articles above, you’ll notice that this article snagged the top spot with 14,600 shares.I can’t say for sure whether or not this ad brought more paying customers, but it sure got a lot of media attention and probably created some loyal fans.The takeaway: If you are trying to target a wide audience with your PPC ads, find the handful of short-tail keywords that have a universal appeal in your market (no matter the searcher), and turn your product page into a landing page that converts your paid traffic into new customers (Slack does this with keywords that are some variation of “collaboration”, “messaging” or “communication.”)[Tip #9] The 8 Section Hybrid Product Landing Page You Can Use To Convert Organic AND Paid TrafficAs mentioned above, Slack only has 2 landing pages that they currently use for their paid ads - either their homepage or their product page.Slack’s homepage (up until just a few days ago), looked like this:Recently, Slack revamped its homepage to make the design a little more streamlined and make their unique selling proposition (USP) more specific.They’ve kept the motto and the vibrant “Get Started” CTA button.I found out that they are doing the following a/b test on the above-the-fold section of their homepage to see which performs better:Test A: “Get Started” button, then email address opt-in field (2 step opt-in)Test B: Email address opt-in field directly on the page (1 step opt-in)Click here to reveal the a/b testing tool Slack uses to test their homepageThe biggest change from their redesigned homepage is that they’ve added some social proof to the homepage (which is something that basically any homepage can benefit from):Slack’s homepage is where they direct people who find them via branded keywords:After all, if someone already knows enough about Slack to type their brand name directly into the search bar, you hardly need to overwhelm them with extra info or a full-fledged sales page. Really, all they need is an easy next step. In this case, clicking the “Get Started” button.On the homepage, the audience can get more info if they scroll down to the very bottom of the page.But by making this section not stand out, it prevents the reader from getting distracted and instantly draws their eyes to the CTA button as the only logical next step.Beyond the homepage, Slack also uses their Product page as a landing page. Interestingly enough, this isn’t a special landing page that can only be found by clicking on a paid Slack ad. You can actually find it by clicking on the “Why Slack?” text link in their website footer.Though the Product page is certainly longer than the homepage, it is by no means text heavy; instead,it revolves around a very streamlined message and a lot of white space.Just like the homepage, the Product page recently underwent a makeover with a shortened page, simplified copy, less sections, less features and benefits.Slack is taking advantage of its own brand awareness. So many people already know what Slack is, they don’t need their landing page to do as much of the “selling for them.”Let’s break down the page scroll-by-scroll to see what’s going on.Here’s what the landing page looks like above-the-fold:A prominently displayed 5 word headline is the first thing a person sees. It tells you very simply what Slack is for.A simple, concise description of what Slack offers. Misunderstanding due to bad team communication is a pretty universal pain point, so it’s good to give the audience a reminder of what Slack does early on.A large modern image with a team of 4 collaborating together. Big, high-res, well-designed images like this are being used more and more by big companies today as people are used to scrolling down a web page.4. A quick breakdown of Slack’s primary benefit: “It simplifies communication.” This is followed by a one sentence description of how this will benefit you and a screenshot of what team communication looks like inside Slack.Golden Nugget: Use a social proof testimonial related to the benefit you are showcasing directly below it. It will convert even higher if you use a headshot of the real person and a testimonial from a well-known brand name (Slack is doing this with their Shopify text testimonial).5. This section is a feature-benefit hybrid. Thebenefitis that Slack “helps everyone find the answers they need.” People are able to get this benefit with Slack’s “archive and search”feature.Combining these two persuasion elements into one helps Slack get their message streamlined for shorter, simpler copy.It also makes people more impressed with this “archive and search” feature... a feature would be decidedly unsexy and unexciting without the explanation of the benefit.And of course, this section is followed by another powerful bit of social proof.6. Here is another benefit that comes thanks to Slack’s many integrations. No one likes transitioning to a new software or program, so this is the exact message that people want to here: the transition will be easy and you can easily tie it into all the products you already use and love.7. The last section on the page to filter large enterprise leads to Slack’s Enterprise page.8. The landing page’s primary CTA. By highlighting the fact that Slack is free, what reason would a prospect have to not click the CTA and try it out?Take note of how there is no mention of Slack’s paid plan on the entire page. The emphasis on the free plan makes prospects feel like they are NOT being sold to, which in turn gives people a more favorable impression of Slack overall.The takeaway: Your product landing page doesn’t need to be overly complicated. Keep it simple (Slack does this with a clear headline, a subhead that addresses a universal pain point, minimal imagery and lots of whitespace, short descriptions of features and benefits, lots of social proof, and having prominent CTAs that emphasize their free offering).[Tip #10] The “Sticky” App Directory SEO Ranking Strategy That Works Without Content MarketingBased on Slack’s organic search results, they have 638 keywords that rank on the first page of Google, and 345 that rank on the first page of Bing/Yahoo!.This number of first page ranking keywords is significantly lower than what you find with many other high-performing SaaS companies.When I analyzed HubSpot here, for example, I found that they have an impressive 5,905 first page keywords on Google and 10,440 on Bing/Yahoo!.But there’s a pretty easy answer to this. Unlike HubSpot, who puts a lot of effort into building up their SEO through content marketing, Slack has adopted different methods.So while HubSpot will show up for search phrases like “how to use excel” because they wrote a blog post on the topic, Slack hasn’t created any content marketing articles for the express purpose of SEO and organic traffic.Instead, a big part of Slack’s organic SEO success comes from Slack’s App Directory landing pages.Here’s an overview of some of Slack’s top organic keywords with the highest global monthly search volume by rank on the first page of Google to give you an idea of how this works:KeywordGlobal Monthly Search VolumeOrganic ListingRankgoogle drive6,120,000https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS32P-google-drive7google calendar1,830,000https://slack.com/apps/A0F8149ED-google-calendar6windows201,000https://slack.com/beta/windows5trello110,000https://slack.com/apps/A0F814C4R-trello6jira90,500https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS3MZ-jira7wunderlist60,500https://slack.com/apps/A0F7VRHTN-wunderlist7giphy49,500https://slack.com/apps/A0F827J2C-giphy4pingdom12,100https://slack.com/apps/A0F814AV7-pingdom4zapier12,100https://slack.com/apps/A024R9PQM-zapier3todo8,100https://slack.com/apps/A0HBTUUPK--todo5As you can see here quite obviously, the people who type in these keywords aren’t specifically searching for Slack. Yet, people who search for these other products often see Slack’s website.Why?Well, the first thing to note is that each and every one of these are products that have integration capabilities with Slack. So, Slack took advantage of this to make sure they often end up on the first page search results whenever anyone searches a product they integrate with.To do this, Slack has an individual webpage for each of their integrations. Some are created by App Directory Partners, while major integrations are often created by Slack themself.For Slack created integration webpages, each webpage follows the same simple 3-part sequence for their SEO strategy:#1. The name of the integration in the webpage’s headline#2. One sentence explaining what the integration is#3. One sentence explaining how the integration works with SlackHere’s an example of what this looks like for the integrationPingdom:Take note, the smart folks over at Slack know that having an App Directory is critical to their long term success. Why? Because the more integrations people add to their Slack, the more “sticky” they will become as their whole work becomes fully integrated into Slack.Slack literally becomes (as their slogan so aptly describes)... “Where work happens.”The takeaway: If you have the type of product that you can create integrations for, don’t miss out on the SEO boost you can get from an App Directory. Plus, more integrations = a “stickier” product.If you don’t have the type of product that you can create an app directory for, don’t miss out on the chance to make your product “stickier.” Find ways to partner with other complementary products and services your customers already use.Not only will this help you tie your product tighter to your customers’ lives, but you can also create your own little SEO boost by showcasing these partnerships on individual landing pages.[Tip #11] The Viral Invite Loop That Generated 4 Million Daily Active Users In 4 YearsSlack is a champ at getting free advertising out of its users (their Twitter “wall of love” is a perfect example).Another way they do this is through theirviral invite loop. The viral invite loop is a powerful growth strategy that encourages others to share your app or product.Here’s how it works:User signs up% of those users invite their friends (or in Slack’s case, other team members)% of those friends/team members become new sign upsViral Invite Loop [Source]The most important thing here is to make it very easy for people to invite others. Slack does this by asking new users to invite people when they first sign up:Reminding people to invite other users during the first onboarding tutorial:And reminding you again through emails:Once you install Slack, it’s natural that you’re going to need teammates to communicate with.This helps add more and more daily active users to the Slack platform.This is a common strategy for social platforms (like Snapchat) which become more valuable with the more friends you have.Slack and Snapchat aren’t that difficult to get people to share because you can use them together with your coworkers and friends.But if you don’t have a product that seems natural to share, you have to give users an extra reason to do so. This is what Booking does.They give users (and the person the user invites) a $25 bonus for new sign ups. This obviously gives people a pretty good reason to share Booking with their network.The takeaway: Make it easy for customers to share your app or product and make sure you give them a reason to do so. This could be so customers can interact with their invitees on the platform (which is what Slack and Snapchat do).If that doesn’t make sense for your product, give customers another reason to share your product (which Booking does by offering a cash bonus).[Tip #12]The Reverse Pricing Model You Can Use To Make Your Customers Say “Wow” On Social MediaOne thing Slack is well-known for (and something that impressed me as soon as I heard about it) is their innovative “fair billing policy.”In simple terms, here’s how their policy works: if a Slack user stops using the software for 14 days, Slack will give you your money back through prorated credit.Slack’s Head of Customer Success explained this himself at the very end ofthis panel at SaaStock London(29:25 to 30:40).Of course, this gives Slack users just another reason to love the app (and that’s the kind of love you need if you want word-of-mouth growth).But there’s an added bonus to using this unique billing policy. As a user consumption model, it forces Slack’s growth to correlate with their customers growth. Otherwise, this happens:The email Slack sends you when you get credit backSales people can’t just sell an account and then move on.For this reason, Slack MUST make sure their product is the best it can be and fully integrates into their users’ day-to-day work… or they won’t get paid.As of today, this type of “fair billing policy” isn’t very widespread nor has it been adopted by any of the big names in SaaS besides Slack (for now, at least).But I was able to find a few SaaS companies bold enough to treat their customers like humans and only make them pay for active users (kudos to these guys for embracing the SaaS pricing model of the future before everyone else catches on):Auth0:SweetProcess:Expensify:Most enterprise software pricing is designed to charge you per user regardless of how many people on your team are actively using the software (for example, if you buy 1,000 seats but only use 100, you still get charged for 1,000).Slack’s pricing model is 100% counterintuitive to that model.Yet, Slack wouldn’t be using this policy if it didn’t work.And before long, this will be the pricing strategy for all SaaS companies who are truly focused on customer success.The takeaway: If you’re in SaaS and think this “fair billing policy” could work for you, give it a shot and see what happens. If you’re not in SaaS or aren’t ready to try out this policy, find another way to make your pricing system transparent and customer-centric.[Tip #13] How Slack Converts 30% Of Their Free Users To Paid UsersHere’s the final piece of the puzzle. Sure, Slack could be using all of the tips above to get free sign-ups… but what’s to guarantee these become paying users later on?Of Slack’s 4+ million active users, 1.25+ million are paid users.The first thing to look at is the layout of Slack’s freemium model.As you can see, Slack’s “free” plan still comes with a bunch of good benefits and is perfectly usable on its own.So, to see how Slack really won over those paid users, I signed up for a free account to see how they’d try to convert me. Here are the 2 big things that jumped out during my experiment:1) Slack has an excellent onboarding process2) Slack isn’t salesy in the slightestLet’s analyze the first item: Slack’s excellent onboarding process.Part of what holds other companies back from converting their freemium users is that these customers often don’t completely understand how to use the product or they don’t truly realize all the product’s benefits and applications.But Slack has an extra challenge in overcoming this. Slack isn’t a product that’s sold to a single person - but one sold to a team. Which means they have a lot of people to convince.Slack responding to a Medium comment as an “extension” of their customer onboardingAnd one of the best ways to convince people is by creating a super smooth (and easy) onboarding process for users. They do this not only to make things easier for individual users, but also so those individual users can help get their entire team on board.Here is a quick example. As part of Slack’s onboarding process, all new users who login for the first time are instantly taken through a tutorial.Slack’s Help Center is also very well laid-out, showing new customers exactly what steps they need to take next.Plus, they also have a ton of helpful info on their YouTube channel and in their Medium publication.In other words, they make sure users understand 100% how to use Slack, as well as how all its features and benefits work.Now onto the second item: Slack’s non-salesy sales process.When I went through the process of a free sign-up, here’s what I discovered: I never, at any point, actually felt like I was being “sold to.”First of all, if we look at Slack’s homepage again, you won’t even find an option to sign up for the paid plan.And after clicking that blue “Get Started” button, you are automatically taken through the process to become a free user…withoutencountering a single message about the paid plan the entire time.When you look through their website, you’ll also notice they don’t have any sort of process in place forgathering full lead dataor contact info.After I signed up, I kept waiting for some sort of email autoresponder campaign aimed at getting me to convert to a paid user. But yet… there was nothing.Not a single email was sent to me with a mention of upgrading to the paid plan.Instead of pushing customers towards the paid plan, Slack set usage limits after a high level of user consumption has taken place. Limits like this:Chat history that stops after 10k messagesFile storage that stops after 5GBApp integrations that stop after 10 appsThis lets the customer decide when they are ready for the paid plan.This keeps Slack ultra-accountable for providing awesome onboarding and a comfortable user experience to not only get them to sign up for the paid plan, but keep as many active users as possible.Is Slack missing out on conversions by not trying to upsell its free users? Maybe. Though it’s obviously not bothering them enough to change it.But the proof is in the data: Slack has a product that people can’t stop talking about and has converted 1.25M+ of their 4M+ users into paid users.So for now, at least, Slack will remain true to their “not a salesperson” voice.The takeaway: You can nail your free to paid conversion rate like Slack does by giving users a fully functional freemium product and creating a high converting onboarding process to help push customers toward the paid conversion.13 Key Takeaways From Slack’s Billion-Dollar SuccessSlack has some pretty atypical brand marketing techniques that have turned them into an impressive SaaS powerhouse.Here are the 13 key takeaways:1. You can’t just launch your product and cross your fingers that people will actually buy. Instead,set your product up for success by following Slack’s 4-step launch formula: convince everyone you know to try your product and give feedback, find your “hook,” invite people to try your “preview release” and then launch to the public.2.Use a different strategy for each social media platform. Slack uses Facebook to update fans, Youtube to drive customer acquisition with professionally produced videos (don’t forget about using that curiosity gap) and Twitter to drive viral awareness with 24/7 customer support.3.Immerse yourself in the podcast worldby sponsoring podcasts your potential audience members are listening to or by creating your own (use this as a chance to make your company “known” for something).4.Don’t miss out on the power of review websites(like Slack did with G2 Crowd) to level up your short-tail keyword SEO strategy. Encourage happy customers to leave you reviews through email campaigns and pop-ups that promise them some type of bonus.5.Find a well-known product or service that your customers are using andpiggyback off their success by integrating with them.Slack did this by partnering with GitHub and Trello.6.If you launch a Medium publication, sign-up through your company’s Twitter or Facebookto grow your Medium following instantly.7. There are certain types of articles that perform best on Medium and have helped Slack skyrocket to success on the platform.The 4 types of posts Slack use are: product updates, product tutorials, practical workplace tips and personal stories.Make sure you adjust your CTAs (like Slack does) to match each type of article.8.If you target your PPC ads to a wide audience, identify the short-tail keywords that have universal appeal.Then, set up an effective landing page to match.9.Don’t make your product landing page more complicated than it needs to be.Only include the info your prospects need to opt-in - nothing more, nothing less.10.Boost your SEO with an app directory (if it makes sense for your product) or try to make your product as “sticky” as possiblefor your customers by partnering with complementary products your customers are already using.11. Turn your customers into promoters for your product by setting up aviral invite loop.12. If you can create a pricing systemthat doesn’t make customers feel like they’re getting screwed over, they’ll love you for it (Slack does this with their “fair billing policy”).13. Getting your customers to convert from free to paid users is tricky.Get a jump on your free to paid conversions by doing what Slack does- give users a fully functional freemium product and create a straightforward onboarding process.Slack gets 100,000,000 website visitors every month. That’s more than Salesforce, HubSpot, Intercom, Zendesk, Mailchimp, Shopify and every other software company in the world.But it’s not all about that.Slack is a role model for what it takes to build a software product loved by both small businesses and fortune 100 companies alike.The secret to marketing is... build a great product.The first version of this growth study was originally published onOpenView Labs.Related Articles1AppSumo Case Study2Tony Robbins Case Study3Supreme Case Study4Amazon Case Study5Shopify Case Study6HubSpot Case Study7Intercom Case Study8MailChimp Case Study910 Ecommerce Case StudiesCommentsPlease enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.Subscribe To Our Newsletter, It's Free*Invalid Email AddressSubmitRead NextEmail MarketingHow to Write a Persuasive Email that Will Increase Your RevenueSumo Growth StudiesThe 5 Biggest Mistakes You’re Making With InfographicsSumo Growth StudiesHow to Tweak Your Email Campaigns for the New NormalPart of the Sumo family withAppSumo,SendFoxandKingSumo. © 2020 Sumo Group, Inc.

Here’s how!byApostle MengoulisJune 18, 20195 minute readThis is the 3rd addition to the“How the hell did they pull this”series- it’s not official, I like to name things.In the past we wrote about:How the Hustle’s milestone referral program earned them 300k fanatics.How Harry’s gathered 100K emails in a single week with a milestone referral program.How a small cosmetics brand got 4K+, and a few thousand in sales in 5 days.It’s already a cliche to try to convince you ifreferral marketingworks or not (of course they do) and why, so instead, this article is solely focused on the how.Numbers are importantDropbox’s referral programis possibly one of the most famous cases ofreferral marketing.Almost a decade later, it’s still used in numerous case studies showcasing how referral programs can contribute to a company’s growth engine- or even be the engine itself.Let’s have a quick dive into Dropbox’s metric history:September 2008: 100K registered usersDecember 2009: 4M registered usersSeptember 2017: 33.9M registered users, 10B evaluation + 1B revenue.What happened between 2008 and 2010? Well, Dropbox managed to double its user base every three months, resulting in its users sending 2.8M invites in April 2010.People, we’re talking abouta 3900% growth in 15 months!Somebody was kind enough to uploada presentationof Drew Houston (Cofounder & CEO, Dropbox), on how they used the lean startup approach to grow Dropbox.Dropbox Startup Lessons Learnedfromgueste94e4cOK, enough with numbers. Let’s get straight to the chase:how did they do it?It’s not all due to the referral program; they gathered a ton of feedback, they continuously improved their product and they kind of put a battle for VC’s to trust their money to them.Since I’m not the best dude to talk about business development, I’ll have to put this aside and try to explain the factors that set this referral to the pantheon.How the Dropbox’s referral program worked.The philosophy ofDropbox’s referral programwas very understandable. Since the product offered storage space in the cloud, they decided to reward people with more free space not only for referring to their friends but also for accepting an invitation.In order words, we’re talking about a2-side referral programfor a compelling product, that rewarded both sides for completing the desired task; registering for Dropbox.We providethe easiest way to build a referral program inspired by Dropbox.1. It was part of the onboarding process.Onboarding users can be such a pain. When people go on to start using a software or a service, they expect they’ll have to fill out some details.I don’t know about you, but when the onboarding process of a product I’m dying to use is easy, a smile carves my face.Dropbox knew this and not only made the whole onboarding a six-step piece of cake, but Dropbox integrated their referral program in it, as a final step.Just like saying ‘thank you’ by offering more of the product.2. People had a clear view of the benefits/rewards.According to Dropbox’s founder/CEODrew Houston, Dropbox’s referral program got inspired by Paypal refer-a-friend program.Check how our latest Form Widget looks like.Paypal rewarded referrals with cash (as this is what their business was about), so Dropbox had to use their product’s primary value in their rewarding system.When someone decides to use a product, they exactly know what they want from it (whether they get what they expected or not is another story). In Dropbox’s case, people wanted cloud storage; the more, the better.I get always asked what one of the top 5 skills in marketing is. I’ll be damned if copywriting is not one of them because context beats content.That’s why instead of ‘Invite your friends’, Dropbox framed the referral program as ‘Get more space’.3. The invitation process was very easy.After the user got hooked with‘getting more space’, the next step was to make it as easy as possible to get it. It was clear that they had to bring their friends on board.They could do so via social media sharing or by just sending their unique referral link in whatever way they wanted (messenger apps, email, SMS, handwritten cards, etc.)But here lies one of the best invitation hacks I’ve ever witnessed. Email is powerful, but sending your invitations to your contacts one by one isn’t so, Dropbox offered the option to sync your contacts from Gmail, AOL, Yahoo!, etc.Victory!4. People knew their referral status.If you’re planning to create a referral program like Dropbox, listen to me, and listen to me good. You want to push users to make enough referrals to attain a prized goal.How do you do it?The easiest way is to make it visible to them how close they are to attaining this goal. I see this in a lot of referral campaigns; I complete the steps, invite my friends and then…Nothing!No notifications or no email, informing how many of my friends successfully registered from my referral link. This is a colossal mistake, people!Dropbox included a panel that was accessible anytime by users, so they can see how the invites performed.5. Dropbox used a Viral Loop on steroids.I became a member ofDropbox from a referral(what a surprise, huh?). I received an email from a friend, signed up, and then I received another email informing me that I was given 500mb for accepting my friend’s invitation.“Sweet”, I thought. In the very same email, there was a P.S.;‘To get even more space, invite your friends or upgrade your Dropbox’, with two links placed respectively.Dropbox grabbed the opportunity in my WOW moment and offered me additional value by prompting me to get more without paying a dime. The goal of Dropbox’s referral program was to attain a more significant audience reach, not a boost in their revenue.It was a chance to open their funnel in a very cost-effective way by just showcasing their will to offer more for less.TL;DRLet’s recap all the essential info from the Dropbox story. First, they managed to attain3900% user growth in 15 months. They did so, by continually improving the product, coming head to head with VCs, and by building a legendary referral programDropbox’s referral program had2-side rewardsand was an overall success because:Offeredan extended versionof the same product.It was part of theonboarding process.People had aclear viewof the benefits.It made itridiculously easyfor people to invite their friends.People knew theirreferral statusat any given time.They managed tobuild a Viral Loop.There you have it! Now, I’m going to step back and think what the next addition to the‘How the hell did they pull this’series (the name remains fictional, but I’ll fight for it).In case you’re interested inbuildinga Dropbox-style referral program, we have your back!

BackgroundThis HR SaaS company needed help driving visitors to their website to request a free trial of their software. They requested our help and came on board for aContent Marketing,SEOandPPCcampaign.2. ObjectiveBecause this business had an audience of HR professionals, we identified that the owner’s own experience in HR made him an excellent potential thought leader. We set about planning a Content Marketing strategy that combined making their blog a highly authoritative source of content, with getting the business owner featured on high authority sites.3. StrategyThe Content Marketing team kicked off by building up a list of websites, magazines and blogs that were read and respected by HR professionals. We focused on writing research-led articles on the company’s specific area of expertise, staying on top of industry trends and news coverage in the sector.We pitched these article topics to editors, tailoring and Ninja-fying our pitches to match the content and style of each publication. We successfully published articles on a number of smaller — but still influential — websites in the HR sector. We continued to get more and more publications and links every month, including publishing on LinkedIn, the social network predominantly used by HR professionals.With the foundations laid and the business owner’s name beginning to get traction in the relevant circles, we focused on pitching to the big boys.Meanwhile, on their blog, we wrote frequent blog posts and guides about different elements of HR. We noticed that a ‘Trends of 2016’ article that we’d written was ranking really well so, at the start of 2017, we wrote an updated version. Before long, this post was ranking top of Google for its target keyword.Not only do the blog posts we write rank really well and bring in a lot of organic traffic, but they also give the client a lot of credibility when we go out to pitch publications.4. ResultsSome of our articles from the campaign’s first year started picking up hundreds of social media shares, mostly via LinkedIn. As HR professionals picked up the articles through LinkedIn, inquiries about the software — as well as requests for demos — began rolling in.We then spoke to a journalist from the Guardian’s small business sector. They had seen our client featured in a number of notable publications and asked him to provide a quote for a Guardian feature. The comment was published in an article on the Guardian’s website — and included a valuable backlink to the client’s website.We later pitched an article to our contact at Entrepreneur, who accepted the company owner as a contributor. His article was published and included a link to the client’s website. The article ranked in over 500 social media shares.In the campaign’s second year, the momentum continued picking up. Articles on HR and recruitment sites routinely started pulling in over 1,500 shares on LinkedIn and Facebook.5. What this meansThis client is now one of the leading thought leaders in their space, and their site is the top-ranking site in ‘performance management’ (their particular branch of HR). The site’s traffic is continuing to increase every month and, with global visibility, they’re expanding the business and continuing to invest in their Exposure Ninja marketing campaign.The site’s ranking chart during the first two years of the Content Marketing CampaignAlthough a UK-based business, their visibility for US searches as a result of our work has allowed them to sell to a global audience.Want these results for YOUR business?Get freeactionablemarketing adviceRequest a review and ouraward-winning teamwill send you a 15-minute video audit of your website and marketing.Need a new website?

Schedule aFree SaaS Scale Sessionto learn more.Which Types of B2B SaaS Content Should You Create First?In a well developed funnel, the majority of prospects in your target audience enter at the top, move to the middle, and eventually move through to the bottom. As such, many SaaS companies begin their content marketing efforts by creating top of funnel contentfirst(eg. simple listicles or how to pieces).The problem with this is that top of funnel content is unlikely to convert readers into leads or customers. So you can spend a year creating content without seeing any actual ROI.The better approach is to actuallybeginwith creating your bottom of the funnel content first (where you’ll see the highest conversion rates). This way you can capture the low hanging fruit:prospects who are directly searching for you or a solution to the problem yourSaaS productsolves.Once you’ve exhausted the key types of content for the bottom of the funnel, you can move into creating middle of the funnel content, and so on.Below we’re going to discuss the content types we’ve seen work best at each stage.Top Types of B2B SaaS Content for Different Stages of the FunnelBefore we dive in, there are a couple of things to take note of.Blogging is atype of content,but blog posts are not the only kind of content that can facilitate lead generation. Non-blog pages such as product pages can also be thought of as content, and should be included in your overall content marketing strategy.Certain characteristics of content changes as you move through the funnel.Regarding these changing characteristics, consider the following graphic:“High,” “Medium,” and “Low” are all relative to each other within the context of your business, but in general,bottom of the funnelcontent will focus on search terms with lower searchvolumeand higher buying intent, and will see the highest conversion rates.Middle of the funnelcontent will focus on search terms with medium search volume and buying intent, and will have fewer conversions. Lastly,top of the funnelcontent will focus on search terms with the highest search volume, but the lowest buying intent, and will see the lowest number of conversions.These heuristics are useful to keep in mind as you plan out your content creation because they can guide your keyword selection, help clarify your understanding of what content at each stage of the funnel is for, and set performance expectations.Now let’s look at the content types we think B2B SaaS companies should focus on first.Bottom of Funnel Content TypesBottom of the funnel content is for prospects who are aware they have a problem and are looking for a way to solve it. The goal of this content is to get these prospects to book a trial or a demo.Based on our experience with 35+ B2B SaaS clients, we have found the following types of content work great for converting prospects with high buying intent, and we’ve listed them in order of highest priority to lowest (ie. we create comparison pages first, then alternatives pages, etc.).Note:Bottom of the funnel content should use clear and compelling calls to action (CTA’s) throughout the page.1. Comparison PagesIn our article onGoogle Ads for SaaS, we discussed the concept of brand versus competitor intent — when a person is researching either:Your brand versus a competitor’s brand (eg. HubSpot vs. Salesforce)A competitor’s brand versus another competitor’s brandRelated:How to Get SaaS Leads Through Your Knowledge Base or Help DeskIn situation ‘A’, creating a piece of content to rank for these terms allows you to control the narrative of this discussion in the eyes of prospects. This way, you get to frame and position your brand against these competitors instead of third parties or your competitors themselves doing it for you.In situation ‘B’, you can leverage a person’s intent to consider two or three of your competitors, and grab ahold of that discussion as well, while also inserting your brand into the mix and siphoning away attention from the others.2. “Alternative to” PagesThere are a couple of scenarios in which people search “[Insert Brand] Alternatives.” One is when they are currently using a service that they’re unhappy with, and they’re looking for other options.The other is when someone in research mode is aware of one brand, and they want to know what alternatives exist so they can weigh their options before making a purchase decision.In both cases, creating content to rank for these terms is valuable, and it’s worth doing for several of your top competitors.3. Product PagesProduct pages typically target keywords that describe the category of the product you offer and/or the solution that people are likely to be searching for.For example, in the case of our client Structure Studios, we built out a product page for them around the keyword “landscape design software” — a term that represents both a product category and a solution.We like to follow a specific format for product pages that we cover in our article onSaaS website best practices(Note:in that piece, we refer to product pages interchangeably withFeature and Benefit pages).Product pages can be some of the most valuable content on your website (if you can get them to rank for the right terms) because the people searching are actively looking for what you offer.4. Use Case PagesIn contrast to product pages, use case pages are not targeting a keyword related to a product or a feature. Rather, they target a specific action that someone is trying to achieve.For example, if you’re a B2B company that sells website visitor identification software, you might create a use case page around the search term “how to identify who visits your website.”Our framework for use case pages is also covered in ourSaaS websites articlementioned above.5. Case Study PagesAt first glance, some SaaS marketers might think of case studies as middle of the funnel content, but if someone is reading a case study on your site, it’s very likely they’re reading because:It’s about a company that’s similar to their ownThey want to see if it’s genuine and reasonable (ie. not some outlier, get-rich-quick scheme)They want to know if they might be able to get the same result using your productThis mindset indicates a reader is genuinely interested in what you have to offer. And thus, we classify case studies as bottom of the funnel content.When it comes to keyword selection, case studies are unique in that pairing them with a keyword that attracts organic traffic is not always obvious or easy — but with some thought and finesse it can and should be done.For example, in acase study on our client Structure Studios, we chose to optimize it for the term “paid media strategy.” While this is more of a middle of the funnel keyword, it gave us the opportunity to create a detailed piece of bottom of funnel content that can also attract prospects through organic search who are situated more towards the middle of the funnel.Middle of the Funnel Content TypesOnce you’ve covered all of your bases on content for the bottom of the funnel, you can begin creating content for the middle of the funnel.The goal of middle of the funnel content is to get prospects to begin imagining what it would be like if they were using your SaaS, and to help establish the value of what you offer. The types of content we’ve found work best are interactive tools, market intelligence pieces, and product tour pages.1. Interactive ToolsThe job of an interactive tool is to provide prospects with a taste of what your SaaS can do for them without needing to fully commit to signing up for a trial or demo.The types of tools we have found work best include:CalculatorsTemplatesCheatsheetsCanvasesQuestionnairesBy giving them a sample of the benefits that come with using your SaaS, you help them begin to see what life could be like if they were using your product, and you generate interest in learning more about what you offer.2. Market Intelligence PiecesThe function of market intelligence pieces is to help establish the business case for using your SaaS.Related:The Long-term SEO Playbook for B2B SaaS CompaniesEspecially when your product has a price point that will need approval from executives up the chain (it’s not something a digital marketing manager can just put on the corporate credit card), this type of content can provide them with something to bring their boss who will ultimately need to sign the check.So creating content that uses charts and graphs to show industry trends and statistics that support the business case for using a SaaS product like yours, you can remove friction in this process. Instead of the digital marketing manager having to do the research on their own, you can provide the information for them.Note:Unlike case studies which need to reflect results your SaaS specifically has achieved, market intelligence pieces can be more high-level, general content about the use of SaaS products like yours across an industry.3. Product Tour PagesProduct tour pages can be thought of as a proxy for demos, and they’re particularly useful for SaaS companies who have multiple types of product offerings that link to each other.The ideal kind of product tour page asks the visitor a little about themselves like their job title, or the use case they are most interested in, and then points them to the part of the product that’s most relevant.What this does is it allows you to take differentbuyer personasdown a different path, tailoring their learning and discovery to their needs and wants, and optimizing the conversion path for prospects.Top of the Funnel Content TypesFinally, once you’ve exhausted your middle and bottom of the funnel content, it can begin to make sense creating top of the funnel content to reach a wider audience.The goal of top of funnel content is to educate cold prospects about the problem you solve (helping them become problem-aware), and also to put your brand on their radar as something they recognize. Whenever possible, you want to present opportunities to move these readers down the funnel (eg. by linking out to middle and bottom of funnel content).The following types of content are what we’ve found work best for top of funnel content.1. Expanded List Posts and Expert RoundupsThese types of blog posts are great for people who are curious, looking to learn about what’s new and relevant, or looking for inspiration in the topic area that’s related to your business.Modern search engines tend to reward list-style posts making them a potential asset with long term SEO benefits.2. Ultimate GuidesThe key to leveraging ultimate guides is to map them to the core use cases of your product.Take our client Hurdlr, for example. Hurdlr’s product is a business expense and mileage tracker. So if we were going to create an ultimate guide for their blog, we could create something like “The Ultimate Guide to Tracking Business Expenses and Mileage.”And from within that guide, we could link out to something like a calculator tool that we’d created previously, guiding readers down the funnel. Those who go and use the calculator are then seeing some of the benefits offered by your SaaS.3. How to Narrative ContentSimilar to the function of ultimate guides, “How to” narrative content is simply taking advantage of the opportunity to show up in search results when someone is looking for how to do the thing that your product helps them accomplish.For example, a clickmaps software called Crazy Egg created a piece called“How to Interpret and Use Clickmaps to Improve Your Website’s UX”— the exact thing their product helps users do.4. Opinion and Thought Leadership PiecesOpinion and Thought Leadership pieces can be useful for generating social media sharing and discovery. They’re often an effective way to grab the attention of your target audience, bring traffic to your site, and generate brand awareness.In addition, showing thought leadership helps build credibility and reputation among the industry you serve.Side note: we have a whole article onSaaS blog designand how to optimize for conversion.Closing ThoughtsGreat content marketing strategy doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. By simply understanding how to prioritize the order in which you create different pieces of content, you can ensure you’re spending your time on content that has the highest chance to generate meaningful revenue increases.And by mapping the types of content you create to your sales funnel like we’ve laid out above, you can ensure you’re reaching the right people with the right type of content (and importantly, at the right time!).We hope this article will help you refine your content strategy and develop a solid plan to move forward.

Why every Saas Company needs to utilize the power of Content - SaaSholicSkip to contentCompaniesTeamContentOur ApproachMenuCompaniesTeamContentOur ApproachApplyWhy every Saas Company needs to utilize the power of Content25 de maio de 2020SaaSBusinesses from many industries can benefit from a well-developed and executed content strategy—and the businesses in the tech and SaaS industry are no exception.Content is what powers inbound marketing, which is why a focused and strategic approach is necessary to improve lead generation and marketing ROI. Developing a Content strategy can be time-consuming and challenging, but it should definitely be a key part of your Marketing. SomeSaas companies hire a marketing agencyto spearhead their content strategy—thus catapulting you to be able to focus on other key parts of your Business.Here are several reasons why a good content marketing strategy can benefit your SaaS business:Content Adds Value Without Divulging Trade SecretsSome businesses may be afraid that producing educational content for their audiences will give away trade secrets. This is an old misconception that does not further your business as much as it hinders it from growing.By providing useful content explaining what you do, its different benefits and applications, and how customers can use it, you can establish your authority as an expert in the field. You also provide transparency—which is greatly valued by potential customers who will perceive you as a brand that can be trusted.Creating versatile content that answers customers’ questions can benefit your business in ways beyond marketing. A comprehensive FAQ and other content that addresses common queries can also relieve your team from the burden of having to answer the same questions between customers.Content can help increase your conversionsCustomers are always looking to learn as much as they can about a product before purchasing. In fact, a study done by ABG essentials showed that Content Marketing provides conversion rates about 6 times higher than other marketing methods. Although many may see content as just a great way to build your brand presence – which it is – it can also help increase your conversion rates, which will lead to more users and customers.In order to employ the power of Content to help increase conversions, make sure to use clear call to actions on what you want the user or visitors to do. The goal can be to grab an email, schedule a demo, or even purchase the product. Whatever the goal may be, make sure to properly showcase it with a clear CTA.Content is Engaging and Can Start ConversationsYour social media pages and profiles are some of the best channels to share great content and receive feedback from your customers. Producing and promoting content means meeting your customers where they are—so the better your social media content strategy, the more people are likely to engage with your business through a relatable medium!Content Can Help Product and Brand DiscoveryComing out with a new idea your customers won’t realize they need yet is tricky. How can you promote this idea when your customers have no way of finding it?The best way is through useful and relevant content that follows an inbound marketing strategy, focusing on customers’ needs and pain points rather than discussing the product itself. By making the most of search engine optimization methods, such as keyword search, you’ll bring the right kind of traffic to your site!Once visitors arrive on your website, they need to know how to navigate it properly to reach the content that’s valuable to them. Having a good structure, user experience and navigation around your website is key to a good conversion process.Content Gives Your Brand PersonalityCustomers always want to feel like they’re interacting with real human beings that they can trust rather than a business or brand that’s just out to make a profit. This is especially true for businesses that produce technical products; your existing content strategy might leave customers scratching their heads, wondering what on earth you’re talking about and how it relates to them. Giving your brand personality builds trust, and trust builds sales.By gearing content towards a more relatable and approachable stance, you’ll be able to show your customers who you are and why you’re important in their lives. If you’re brave enough, then you might even be able to incorporate a little humor into your blogs orvideo content—which is something they’ll really appreciate!Content Establishes Your Authority as a Thought LeaderIf your content can demonstrate a thorough understanding of your niche and produce a good amount of value-adding content, then audiences are more likely to view your brand with respect and perceive you as an authority figure.Creating content that aims to educate your audience, discuss the state of your industry, and predict future trends leads to a better understanding of your brand’s purpose. Be confident, innovative, and perhaps even a little controversial to show that you are looking to future developments and trends like a professional SaaS company!How to develop an effective Content StrategyI’m sure all these benefits to using Content Marketing sound great, but you may be asking yourself:How do I develop a Content Marketing Strategy?Good news, it’s very simple.For starters, you’ll want to identify your audience. Some forms of Content might work differently and obtain more engagement for some audiences than others, and you will definitely want to know that before creating something that’s not engaging to your target market. Once you’ve identified what your customers and audience engage with, the next step is to put your creative brain to work.Content doesn’t need to be 5-star videos or super expensive photoshoots. You can use tools like canva and photoshop to create quick and easy infographics, or you can write an article about your product and publish it online.Your Content strategy doesn’t need to be overly complex, but it needs to be consistent. Consistency and value are the two secrets to using content as an advantage to your Business.ConclusionWhen done well, content can add plenty of value to your audience—and in turn, it adds value to your business in the form of ROI. It can establish your authority in the industry, engage and gain your audience’s trust, help you market your brand even better and yes, help you reach and acquire new customers. By investing in the right SaaS marketing company, you’ll be able to create a content strategy that can catapult your business to greater heights.Share this post:Deixe um comentárioCancelar respostaO seu endereço de e-mail não será publicado.Campos obrigatórios são marcados com*Comentário*Nome*E-mail*SiteSalvar meus dados neste navegador para a próxima vez que eu comentar.gustavoCompaniesTeamContentOur ApproachApply

10 Biggest Advantages Of SaaS Content Marketing | kenmoo.meAboutContact MeJoin our communityAboutContact MeJoin our community10 Biggest Advantages Of SaaS Content MarketingHave you noticed that almost all of the most popular SaaS companies today have an active blog page?HubSpot,Salesforce,Zendesk—all these SaaS providers have dedicated web pages for educating people through blog posts and sometimes even videos.And that’s not a coincidence. In fact, sharing these types of content is one of the most potent SaaS marketing strategies today.It’s called content marketing.Content marketingis the process of creating and sharing valuable content to attract prospects and convert them into paying customers, and customers into advocates.These types of content can be in many forms. Blog posts are the most common. But it can also be in the form of videos, webinars, e-books, and even infographics.So why exactly is content marketing as powerful as it is when it comes to marketing a SaaS business?This article will talk about the different advantages of SaaS content marketing.Let’s dive right in.Blog Contenthide1. It Is The Most Common Form Of Inbound Marketing2. It Creates Brand Awareness3. It Builds Trust and Credibility4. It Establishes You As A Thought Leader5. It Drives Traffic To Your Website6. It Gives Your Brand A Personality7. It Is Effective In All Stages Of the Customer Journey8. It Works Well With Other Marketing Strategies9. It Is Cost-Effective10. It Can Be Easily OutsourcedFinal Thoughts On The Advantages Of SaaS Content MarketingGet fresh updates in your inbox 👇1. It Is The Most Common Form Of Inbound MarketingInbound marketingis all about attracting potential customers and turning them into leads and users.This is in contrast to outbound marketing, which is a more proactive (but sometimes intrusive) way to market a product.It’s usually done through cold calling and cold emails.While these practices may have worked at some point in time, they may no longer be that effective today.People have become more resistant to advertising and they can easily ignore or block out messages that they don’t want to hear.So you could say that outbound is outdated. In the SaaS market, at least.Content marketing, on the other hand, is a form of inbound marketing. In fact, the two are almost synonymous with each other.It’s all about creating content that is valuable and interesting enough for people to seek it out.When done right, SaaS content marketing can be an extremely effective way to generate leads and customers for your SaaS company.2. It Creates Brand AwarenessOne of the main advantages of SaaS content marketing is that it helps create brand awareness.In order for people to buy your product, they first need to know that your product exists. For them to know that your product exists, they need to know that your brand exists.And one of the most effective ways to do that is by sharing educational and valuable content that’s related to your product or service.For example, let’s say you have a SaaS tool for project management. Now, imagine a certain person who wants to be more productive at work. They don’t know how to do it yet.They don’t even know that a SaaS solution could even help them with that need.So this person does a Google search, looking up “how to complete projects more efficiently.” Coincidentally, you have a blog post that shares some tips on how to be more productive at work or how to better manage team projects.Somehow they find your blog post and start reading. And from that point forward, they start recognizing your blog site as a source of content about work productivity.Et voila. You have built brand awareness using your content. They may not know about your SaaS product yet. But they already know about your brand and website.And this is one of the things that content marketing does.You’re not only providing valuable information to your readers. But in the process, you’re also building your brand and preparing the way for your SaaS product to be known.3. It Builds Trust and CredibilityAnother advantage of SaaS content marketing is that it helps build trust and credibility for your brand.Potential customers are more likely to buy from a company that they know, like, and trust.And one of the best ways to establish trust with potential customers is by providing helpful information without expecting anything in return.When you share helpful tips or advice related to your niche without selling anything, it shows that you really care about helping your target audience. It’s not just about making a quick buck—you genuinely want to see them succeed.And over time, as they keep seeing this type of content from you, they start developing a relationship with your brand.They begin to see you as an expert in your field—someone who can be trusted.This is why content marketing can be such a powerful tool for SaaS companies. It helps you build trust and credibility with potential customers, making it more likely for them to buy from you when they’re finally ready.4. It Establishes You As A Thought LeaderIn addition to building trust and credibility, content marketing takes it up a notch and helps establish you as athought leaderin your industry.Thought leaders are seen as experts in their field. And people are more likely to buy from someone who is seen as an expert.When you consistently produce high-quality content, it positions you as an authority figure in your industry.People begin to see you as someone who knows what they’re talking about.They’ll be more likely to listen to your advice and recommendations. And if you have a SaaS product that can help them, they’ll be more inclined to check it out and even buy it.5. It Drives Traffic To Your WebsiteOne of the most important advantages of SaaS content marketing is that it drives traffic to your website.And more traffic to your website means more opportunities to convert visitors into leads and eventually customers.You see, when you publish helpful and informative content, people will naturally want to learn more about you and what you have to offer.They’ll visit your website to learn more and, if you’ve done your job right, they’ll be impressed by what they see.From there, it’s just a matter of providing an easy way for them to sign up for your product or service.And voila. You’ve just increased your chances of making a sale.6. It Gives Your Brand A PersonalityContent marketing gives your SaaS brand a personality. It helps you connect with your target audience on a more personal level.People like doing business with brands that they feel they know. And when you produce quality content, it humanizes your brand and makes it more relatable.Your readers will begin to see you as more than just a faceless company trying to sell them something. They’ll see you as a valuable source of information and someone they can trust.7. It Is Effective In All Stages Of the Customer JourneyIt’s important to realize that content marketing is effective in all stages of the customer journey—not just the beginning. Sure, it’s great for building brand awareness, setting yourself up as an authority, and getting people interested in your SaaS product. But it can also be used tonurture your leads, close sales, and improve customer retention.That’s because content can come in many forms. Even blogs can be written in many different ways depending on their purpose.These include educational blog posts, buyers’ guides, and product comparison blog posts.Educational Blog PostsThese are blog posts that teach your target audience about different concepts related to your field. They don’t even have to mention your SaaS product.That’s because the purpose is to educate, thereby building credibility and trust with your audience.And because customer relationships are about trust and providing value, educational content can help in all parts of the customer journey.You get to introduce your brand to prospects who don’t know you yet.You get to build rapport with those who are still deciding what SaaS product to buy.You get to further cement your relationship with existing customers.Educational content helps you nurture your relationships with prospects and customers all throughout theSaaS sales funnel.Buyers’ GuidesThese are blog posts that help your target audience make a buying decision by comparing different products in the market.This is especially useful for prospects who are still in the consideration stage and are weighing different options.Buyers’ guides provide an impartial look at different products, which can help build trust with your audience.Not only do you compare these different SaaS product. But you can also highlight the features that make them stand out.What’s more, you could also make recommendations on which solutions would be best for a particular pain point.For example, let’s say you have a buyers’ guide on customer relationship management (CRM) software.You could recommend HubSpot to users that want a free CRM solution. Or you could say thatPipedriveis an excellent choice for users that want great visuals for their pipelines and reports.And if you’re offering a highly customizable CRM solution, you could feature your own SaaS product as the best choice for users looking for customizability.Now, notice that we used the word “impartial.”Remember that your content has to be credible and reliable. If you’re just promoting your SaaS product out of sheer bias, you might lose your audience’s trust.Be sure to provide an honest and objective look at each product. Otherwise, you’ll lose the trust of your audience—and that’s something you can’t afford to do.But don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying you shouldn’t feature your own SaaS solution. You just don’t do it at the expense of your credibility.You should still highlight the strengths of your SaaS product. But you should always ALWAYS provide solid facts to back up your claim. That’s how you can promote your own SaaS solution without sounding biased.Product Comparison Blog PostsThese are similar to buyers’ guides, except that they compare two (or more) products side-by-side.Product comparison blog posts provide a detailed look at the features of each product and how they stack up against each other. It’s also a great content type to showcase each of the product’s pros and cons relative to each other.This is a great way to show your audience that you have in-depth knowledge about your industry and that you’re an expert in your field.It’s also an excellent opportunity to promote your SaaS product. After all, you can use these blog posts to show why your solution is better than the competition.And because you’re already talking about other products in the market, your audience will know that you’re not just promoting your own solution for the sake of it.Remember, though, that you should always be impartial in your comparisons. I cannot stress that enough.Whatever claim you make, back it up with reliable data.Otherwise, you’ll lose credibility with your audience.8. It Works Well With Other Marketing StrategiesSaaS content marketing can be a great complement to other marketing strategies. Some of these strategies include the following:Search Engine OptimizationSocial Media MarketingEmail MarketingSearch Engine Optimization (SEO)SEOis the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This, in turn, can help you drive more traffic to your site.SEO often works hand in hand with content marketing. After all, even if you create the most reliable and most engaging content out there, if it doesn’t appear on Google searches, only a few people will see it.So you need SEO to bolster your marketing efforts. One way to optimize your site for SEO is to create blog posts that target specific keywords.For example, let’s say you want to rank for the keyword “best CRM software.”You could create a blog post titled “The 5 Best CRM Software Solutions for Small Businesses.”In this blog post, you could talk about different CRM software solutions and how they can benefit small businesses. You could then include a link to your own SaaS product in the blog post.This way, you’re not only targeting a specific keyword with your content, but you’re also promoting your SaaS solution at the same time.Social Media MarketingSocial media marketingis another excellent way to complement your content marketing strategy.With social media marketing, you can promote your content on different platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You can also use social media to drive traffic back to your website.And like SEO, social media marketing can help you reach a larger audience and promote your content to a wider range of people.Email MarketingEmail marketingis yet another strategy that works well with content marketing.With email marketing, you can send your content directly to your audience’s inbox. This is a great way to ensure that your audience sees your content and that they have the opportunity to read it.Email marketing can also help you drive traffic back to your website. For example, you can include links to your latest blog post or video in your email newsletter.9. It Is Cost-EffectiveOne of the advantages of SaaS content marketing is that it is a cost-effective marketing strategy.With SaaS content marketing, you can reach a large audience without having to spend a lot of money on ads.You can also repurpose your content to get the most out of it. For example, you can turn a blog post into a video, infographic, or podcast.This way, you can get more bang for your buck and reach even more people with your content.10. It Can Be Easily OutsourcedAnother advantage of SaaS content marketing is that it can be easily outsourced.If you don’t have the time or resources to create content yourself, you can always hire someone to do it for you.There are a lot of freelance writers and content creators out there who would be more than happy to help you with your content marketing efforts.Or if your budget would allow it, you can also hire a content marketing agency. They could run your content marketing efforts at a larger scale and with better coordination.So if you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t worry. You can always outsource your content marketing to someone else.Final Thoughts On The Advantages Of SaaS Content MarketingAs you can see, there are many advantages of SaaS content marketing.Content marketing isn’t just about promoting a product to your target audience. It’s not just about the hype.Content marketing is more about setting yourself up as a trustworthy brand.It’s one of the most organic ways (if not the most organic way) to draw the attention of your potential buyers and convert them into paying customers.So if you’re looking for a way to market your SaaS product, content marketing is definitely worth considering.Want more strategies and guides to growing your SaaS business?

How SaaS Companies Win with Content Marketing? - Marketing Insider GroupMenuSkip to contentHomeServicesSEO Blog Writing ServiceContent Marketing StrategyContent Marketing CourseAboutCase StudiesBooksContact UsBlogGet More TrafficSearch for:How SaaS Companies Win with Content Marketing?Content MarketingByMichael BrenneronApril 19, 2022inContent MarketingFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailPocketSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) companies live in a universe of mathematical code, complex processes, and highly technical jargon.Potential customers need someone to unpack all that jargon and explain it to them in plain English – or whatever language they speak.That need makes SaaS companies a perfect fit for content marketing. Can they still win with it, even in a saturated space? A better question would be, “Can they win without content marketing?” The answer, as we’ll explain in more detail, is “No.”Quick Takeaways:SaaS brands need to communicate complexity with simplicity.Since the SaaS business model requires a long-term customer relationship, content that forms and nurtures that relationship is essential.Content marketing builds brand awareness in a crowded field and drives ROI.With a comprehensive content marketing strategy, SaaS brands can showcase their products’ unique value.SaaS Brands Need a Long-Term Marketing StrategyOne of the most compelling advantages SaaS customers enjoy is convenience. They can set their subscription to renew automatically or at the touch of a button. There’s no need to go online or out to a store to buy a new box of software. It’s along-term customer relationship.These brands, therefore, need a marketing strategy that nurtures that relationship. Content that informs potential customers about what the service can do for them can help. Blog posts, videos, and other types of content that enable existing customers to get the most out of their SaaS investment, too, are valuable ways to ensure customer loyalty and referrals.Content Marketing Builds Brand AwarenessUnless your SaaS company is an industry giant, you need to inform your target customers that you have a service that can help them. Content marketing can do just that. In fact, Neil Patel has steered his SEO software service into a business powerhouse simply by providing customers and prospects actionable information on his blog and newsletter.For small-to-medium-sized SaaS companies, content marketing is easy on the budget and can drive more sales than traditional marketing strategies. According toDemandMetric, it costs 62 percent less and produces three times more leads than advertising and other marketing strategies.Informative content can help prospects see the value your service can bring to their business or their lives. SaaS services can differentiate themselves from their competitors with content that points out the advantages of choosing them to do business with.Image courtesy ofDemand MetricSaaS Companies That Use Content Marketing See a Dramatic Rise in ROIAs Keap’sPratik Dholakiyapoints out, statistics show that SaaS companies that leverage content marketing enjoy returns of as much as 657 percent on their investment. Now, that’s what I’d call winning. Whether yours is a startup, a legacy brand, or somewhere in between, those numbers are hard to refute.SaaS StartupsMany of the SaaS brands who were mere startups only a few years ago have risen to global prominence, thanks to strategic content marketing. HubSpot, for one, has experienced incredible growth from its content marketing, as has SEO software provider Moz.Legacy BrandsSimilarly, technology brands whose roots lie in the previous century can use content marketing to keep a step ahead of the ever-growing number of upstarts. For instance, legacy SaaS giant IBM maintains its relevance even today through a massive library ofthought leadership content, much of it created by regular employees, not only its marketing department.Strategy Is the Key to SaaS Content Marketing SuccessContent marketing for SaaS companies, though, needs a solid strategy to drive those numbers into that 657 percent range and upward. Let’s take a look at marketing strategies that have proven to yield results for SaaS brands.Leverage employee expertise in SaaS content for optimum resultsBrands, like IBM, that showcase their employees’ expertise through content marketing build trust among their prospects. Statistics show thatemployee-generated leadsare seven times more likely to convert than traditional marketing messages.Furthermore, content that non-marketing employees create yields eight times more engagement than ones that come from sales and marketing teams. When you bring subject matter experts in on the content marketing process, your brand’s authenticity shines through.Make it all about the customerToday’s customers want to deal with a company that they can trust – a business that is an authority in its field. Customer-centric content marketing is the best way to earn your prospects’ trust.Study customer dataContent marketing, done right, starts with a deep dive into your prospects’ and customers’ data. Knowing their needs, their desires, and their pain points can give your content teams enough insight to create content that helps them rise to meet their challenges.Segment your email audiencesSegmenting your audiences is critical, especially when it comes to email newsletters. Microsoft, for instance, has a broad spectrum of target audiences it needs to reach with information about its flagship product, Microsoft 365. From home users to small businesses to enterprises in various fields, they span a wide range.Microsoft 365’s blog posts reflect that diversity, with some of them directed at meeting the needs of specific customer segments, while other posts provide material of general interest. Using an industry-specific menu of static content, the site’s analytics can differentiate users in the healthcare industry from those in retail, for example. That way, when a user becomes a subscriber, the company can personalize the content it sends to the user’s unique needs.Screenshot courtesy of Microsoft 365If you don’t use your users’ online activity to segment audiences, you can also use social media analytics, surveys, or an extra field on your sign-up form to indicate their specific interest.Tackle your customers’ most pressing challengesWhat differentiates effective SaaS content from the mediocre starts here. Defining the problems your customers face is the first step toward solving them. Then, create content in which you outline easy-to-implement steps that they can put into action immediately to solve those problems.Stand out from the crowd with your USPYou don’t need a boring recitation of all your software’s features in a blog post. Prospects want to see what makes it better than its competitors in solvingtheirproblems. Showcase your unique selling proposition with content that shows instead of tells.Use case studies, customer success stories, and how-to posts to demonstrate why and how its features make it a better fit for your target audience’s needs. Create graphs or infographics that tell the story in numbers, especially if your business is primarily B2B.Position yourself as a thought leader in your spaceAs someone in a leadership role in a tech company, you know all too well that yesterday’s “shiny new toy” can quickly become obsolete overnight. Use content marketing to place yourself and your expertise on the leading edge of your industry.Thought-provoking questions and comments on social media can start some buzz around your brand. Fleshing out those thoughts in blog posts, white papers, and ebooks can start turning heads your brand’s way.Use current events that impact your target customers’ industries to extend your reach even further. Unless the event has already been covered to death, sharing your take on an event can demonstrate your brand’s leadership and foresight.Offer a free trial as a call to action in bottom-of-the-funnel contentIf your service lives up to the standards that your content promised, serious prospects will likely convert into paying customers after a free trial. Unless they use your software to handle a one-off problem, chances are that they’ll discover how well your software works to make their day-to-day work easier. If the cost to get your product into your prospects’ hands for a few days plus customer acquisition costs is less than thecustomer’s lifetime value, then a free trial is well worth your trouble.Provide trial users with specialized content that helps them get the most value out of their trial subscription. When they see the success that your software can provide to them in only a few days, they’ll be likely to pull the trigger and subscribe as a paid customer.After the sale, keep customers loyal with gated content that only customers can access. Focus that content on teaching your customers better ways to use your product.Use account-based marketing content to land your big accountsSome prospects offer the potential for a huge influx of revenue. Usually, these companies are large enterprises with a massive user base (if you price per user).Or, these firms might be so well-known that having them as a customer will position you as a leader in your field. When other companies see that this company has signed on, they’ll be more likely to jump on the bandwagon, too.Account-based marketing (ABM) content is labor-intensive, but the benefits of acquiring such a customer are well worth the effort. Start by looking at the challenges each of the target company’s main decision-makers face and create content that addresses those concerns.Collaborating with your sales and customer service teams can help you identify common objections and feedback that your prospect and similar companies face. Subject matter experts, such as your development and design teams, can provide information about the technical details that make your product the one solution that will answer your prospect’s objections and solve their problems.As time goes on, you can keep a repository of effective account-based marketing content that you can tweak and repurpose for future prospects. Doing so will allow you to extend amodified ABM strategyto several major prospects at the same time.Content marketing stands heads above other marketing strategies for SaaS companies. Its adaptability to the unique needs of SaaS brands will make it a major player in the space for years to come.If you are ready to get more traffic to your site with quality content published consistently, check out ourContent Builder Service.

Sure, content marketing is the best tool SaaS brands can use to reach target customers, build trust with them and draw them to their business, converting them into customers.First, understand your customers’ pain points well and provide the right kind of content that helps them solve those pains.Michael Brennersays:March 3, 2021 at 1:10 pmThanks James!Rob Simssays:April 20, 2022 at 8:40 amMichael, this is excellent. I wanted to add a content tactic that aligns with your long-term marketing discussion. I worked for a firm that delivered SaaS learning solutions to FDA-regulated industries. We focused on “advocacy content” – we targeted educational materials to the roles that selected and leveraged our solution. We would interview experts, attend conferences and just gather best practices in their profession – and sometimes this content pushed the conversation past our own SaaS features and benefits. This helped us foster a strong community among our users, and secondarily delivered valuable intelligence to our product team. Thanks again for the perfect model for SaaS marketing.Michael Brennersays:May 10, 2022 at 4:08 pmThat’s a great example Rob. Thanks so much for sharing. I’m a big fan of advocacy content, interview-based and expert-driven content, and I love content curated from industry trade shows.

At DemandJump, we love to offercontent ideas for SaaS companiesby providing guides on content marketing and examples of how it all works.But why should you use content marketing for your own B2B SaaS company? Is it really worth the effort? In this blog, we explore why SaaS content marketing is a great way to reach your audience and boost their engagement.What Is B2B SaaS Content Marketing?B2B SaaS content marketing is the process of leveraging your own published web content—blogs, white papers, videos, etc.—to offer measurable value to your target audience. It is also meant to engage with them directly in order to capture their attention and guide them toward a sale. But what does that mean, exactly? Essentially, content marketing is producing valuable content for your audience to help answer their questions and providing a solution—typically your product or service.In our ultimate guide, we explain thatcontent marketinginvolves three key elements:Understanding who your best customers are.Determining how and where those customers find solutions to their problems.Providing immediate solutions in the form of informative, engaging, and authoritative content.Are There Any Benefits to Content Marketing?So why create this content? First thing’s first, it is helpful to your target audience to find content that actually answers their questions. How many times have you searched for something on Google only to scroll through several sites that don’t provide a real answer? Content marketing for SaaS aims to fix that. There’s no doubt: if you produce high-quality content you’ll earn the trust of your audience. Not only that, but you’ll be creating valuable information for other searchers who might not know about your product or service.Is there really any benefit to putting employee and financial resources into content marketing? According to theContent Marketing Institute, 67% of marketers say content marketing creates leads for their product or service. Additionally, 72% of marketers report that content marketing supports audience learning and 63% believe it promotes consumer loyalty. Ideally, creating this content using high-value keywords and quality answers to questions will lead to higher rankings on Google, more click-through rates, and increased conversions.While your marketing success can be enhanced by using paid search, social media, email marketing, as well as other strategies to promote the content and increase visitors, content marketing can help boost organic results with the right strategy. We’ll dive into a digital marketing strategy for SaaS later on, but ultimately content marketing should focus on writing great content for audiences, which will drive profitable organic results.What Is the Role of Content Marketing in a Fast Growing SaaS Business?It’s simple: the role of content marketing for SaaS businesses is to have higher visibility and greater reach among a target audience, while providing them with awesome content. While it isn’t as simple as writing a few blogs and stuffing keywords into the text, once you consider different content marketing strategies and develop a plan, you’ll find great success in reaching your goals.With B2B SaaS businesses, content marketing provides an avenue for your business to promote your solution as an answer to your audience's pain points. Because SaaS companies offer software solutions, it’s beneficial to share in-depth, knowledgeablecontentthat shows your business understands what the audience is looking for and how you can help.How to Create a SaaS Content Strategy that Drives ProductThe majority of marketing techniques need extensive research and development, which can be costly for SaaS companies. It can also take a lot of effort, since you may need to spend hours or even days learning about your competition and potential high-value keywords. At DemandJump, we’ve created a powerful content marketing strategy framework calledPillar-Based Marketing(PBM) that eliminates guesswork and ensures you get the most from your SaaS digital marketing.The idea of PBM is to generate a wealth of interconnected content from Pillar Pages to Sub-Pillar Pages to Supporting Blogs. The key is in the keywords and connection between the content, making you an authority on any given topic—and Google rewards this by boosting the rank of your site on search engine results pages (SERPs) since you provide extensive and helpful information.So what does creating a PBM strategy look like? First, we need to break down the pieces:Pillar: “The Ultimate Guide” — A comprehensive piece of content that explores your main topic in detail. (~3,000 words / ~20 keywords)Sub-Pillar: A more focused piece of content that explores a sub-topic within the pillar. (~2,000 words / ~15 keywords)Supporting Blog: A very specific piece of content that answers a few questions related to the sub-pillar or pillar topic. (750 words / 7-8 keywords)Using a PBM framework, you should start by developing a 16-piece pillar strategy that answers all questions on a certain topic. With 1 pillar page, 3 sub-pillars, and 12 supporting blogs, each article will be connected directly to the other pieces of content.Now we can get started building a Pillar-Based Marketing strategy:Determine a topic relevant to your business that you’d like to rank for on search engines.Explore high-ranking, relevant keywords and phrases to learn more about what your customers are looking for online.Write informative, valuable content using those keywords and phrases to reach your target audience. Don’t forget to write 1 Pillar Page, 3 Sub-Pillars, and 12 Supporting Blogs to complete your content strategy.Post your content on your website. You should post it all at once, rather than individually when they are written. That will boost the SEO “juice.”Sounds simple, right? The process can be difficult without the right tools—doing your own research is time-consuming (and expensive)—but PBM is built with DemandJump in mind. Our platform provides you with insight reports that help you develop your strategy and find high-ranking keywords. We are the experts when it comes to SEO research and content creation. As the exclusive PBM provider, we have created our solutions from the bottom up to help you create the greatest marketing plan for your company and achieve fantastic results.Please Share:Featured ArticlesCategoriesAttribution Tracking(13)Channel Optimization(11)Consumer Insights(68)Content Marketing(246)Data Science(8)Digital Marketing(6)Digital Transformation(26)Enterprise(10)Lead Generation(14)Market Intelligence(8)Marketing Analytics(39)Marketing Attribution(57)Marketing Management(153)Marketing Operations(86)Organic Search(218)Paid Search(52)Pillar-Based Marketing(43)Programmatic Advertising(9)SaaS Content(2)SaaS Marketing(29)Search Marketing(111)SEO Keyword Research(12)SEO Pillar(17)SEO Strategy(3)SMB(5)Website Content(12)See allPlatformContentInsightsPricingContentContent MarketingContent StrategyContent Marketing ExamplesContent WritingInsightsBuyer BehaviorConsumer InsightsTypes of Consumer InsightsSEO Content StrategyKeyword ResearchSEO Keyword ResearchKeyword GeneratorSEO Keyword Research ToolKeyword Research TipsResourcesAboutBlogContactSitemap10 W Market Street, Suite 1950 Indianapolis, IN 46204© 2023DemandJump Inc.All rights reservedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions
